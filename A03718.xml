            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which, though it be not of like qualitie with the former, yet I doubt not, but it ſhal prooue profitable to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as with diligence and indifferencie ſhall vouchſafe it the pervſing. The Author (albeit not ſpecified heerin by name) ſeemeth to be a man of great reading, ſingular iudgement, and
<pb facs="tcp:17967:3"/> excellent dexteritie, in handling the matter which he vndertooke. The worke a notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of that <hi>Abaddon,</hi> or <hi>deſtroieng eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> the <hi>ſonne of perdition, that ſitteth in the temple of God, as God;</hi> wherein both his defacing of the glorie of the ſonne of God in heauen, whoſe vicegerent he would be counted, and his trampling vnder feete whatſoeuer is called God amongst men, beſides his manifold violences committed against the Church and Saints of God, are most liuelie depainted and ſet before our eies. Many woorthie wits of rare gifts haue trauelled in laieng open his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations, villanies, and outrages, with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and proceſſe, cauſes and effects, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and conſequents of the ſame, acording as they were occaſioned. But this man hath draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into one entire bodie a great manie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable points, which are diſperſedly found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that he that listeth may at once take a view, as it were, of ſuch an vglie monster, as would trouble the ſtrongest fantaſie in the world to imagine, and the most curious hand to pourtray the like. Howbeit, it is not much to be hoped for, that the Italianate atheists and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Papists (of which there are ſuch ſwarmes amongst vs) will any thing at all be mooued with the cleere light of theſe moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

For it is greatly to be feared, least, by a iust iudgement of the almightie, they are become past feeling, ſo that they grope as the blind at noone day, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to all deceiueablenes of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through a <hi>ſtrong ſpirit of deluſion, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not receiue the loue of the truth that they might be ſaued.</hi> But howſoeuer their harts be as hard as the ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and their eies couered with the mist of palpable darknes euen to this day: yet wiſedom ſhal be iuſtified of hir children. Whom God hath foreappointed to be beholders of his glorie, they ſhall in their due time be inlightened with the knowledge of his ſauing truth, and come out of Babylon with as great ſpeede, as euer the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites posted out of Egypt. Yea, they ſhall clap their hands at the ruine of that Antichristian ſynagog, which being now tottering and readie to fall to the ground, laboreth with might and maine, by force and fraud, by treacherous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, by cruell practiſes, and open inuaſions, as it were by mingling heauen and earth togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to vphold it ſelfe: as may be ſeene in most places of Europe at this day. But he that ſitteth
<pb facs="tcp:17967:4"/> in heauen, laugheth them to ſcorne, the Lord ſhall haue them in deriſion. Whoſe words tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ouerthrow of Babylon, cannot fall to the ground, but must be fulfilled in their time. For doubtles <hi>Babylon muſt fal,</hi> &amp; be <hi>rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to hir works:</hi> the kings of the earth ſhall loath and perſecute this vniuerſall ſtrumpet, to make hir deſolate &amp; naked, to eate hir fleſh &amp; conſume hir with fire. Thriſe bleſſed are they, that band themſelues togither, &amp; bend their whole forces to execute theſe iudgements of the Lord, which he hath decreed vpon hir. In which reſpect your H. hath great cauſe to magnifie the Lord for his gratious mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, in that he hath vouchſafed you this honor, to ſtand in armes against one of hir prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall louers, in ſo iust and holie a quarell, as is the maintenance of his ſacred religion, and the deliuering of the helpleſſe out of the hands of the oppreſſor, ſo aduiſedly and neceſſarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by hir excellent maiestie. A thing iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable by the lawes of God and man, of nature and nations, yea warranted by the like practiſe of most Christian Emperors in former ages, and ſundrie other good preſidents of antiquitie. Now, ſeeing God hath dealt ſo mercifully with you, it is your H. part, to behaue your ſelfe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and to fight the Lords battels with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
<pb facs="tcp:17967:4"/> He is on your ſide: therefore you are on the mountaines, and your enimies in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: he ſhall be a braſen wall to defend you on euerie ſide, if you ſet his feare before you, and repoſe your trust in him. The garde of his holie Angels ſhall be a ſurer protection vnto you, than any trench, bulwarke, or fortreſſe you can deuiſe. The praiers of all the godlie in the land being deeply touched with an inward ſympathie and fellow-feeling of their neighbors calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are powred out continually for your ſafetie and happie ſucceſſe in this noble enterpiſe: and your H. may be well aſſured, that they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure more fauour to you at the hands of the Lord, than any either aduerſarie forces, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations of the holy Tridentine league ſhal be able to preuaile to the contrarie. Wherfore, my Lord, arme your ſelfe with Christian courage, policie and warines against theſe vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Philistins: remember that they with whom you fight are deuowed vaſſals to that beast, which is deſcribed in this booke: whoſe power (God be thanked) hath been found too weake to ſhake the throne of our gratious Souereigne, notwithſtanding his often aſſaults. His thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts of excommunications and bannings haue beene esteemed as paper-ſhot by thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princes of the houſe of <hi>Borbon</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi>

Should not the conſideration of theſe things increaſe your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and magnanimitie, that you neuer faint nor giue ouer before you ſee a bleſſed end of your labors? Which the Lord of heauen in a tender regard of his poore Church in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, grant vnto you, that in the end returning home, you may be receiued with ſuch ioifull acclamations and ſongs of triumph, as Dauid was by the daughters of Iſrael after his victorious ſubduing of the Lords enimies; and in the life to come may be crowned with thoſe pretious bleſſings, which are reſerued for them that to the vttermost of their power helpe the Lord against the mightie.</p>

               <p>BVt ſome peraduenture will ſaie, it is onely impietie &amp; blaſphemie of words. Let vs therefore bring to light the wicked factes of the ſame papacie, a few of many, as it were for examples ſake: that euerie one may vnderſtand, that the popes many yéeres ago did make but a mock and ſcoffe of Chriſtian religion. And firſt of all, that of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeauenth, which we will lay downe in the words of cardinall <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. <hi>The Emperour Henrie the third</hi>
                  </hi> (ſaith
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17967:15"/> he) <hi>was woont often to repaire to praier, to the church of S. Marie, which is in the mount Auentine. But Hildebrand, who being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made pope was called Gregorie the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, when as by his ſpies he made diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie after all his works, he made the place be marked where the Emperour was woont to praie: and he perſwaded one by promiſing him money, to lay great ſtones vpon the beames of the church ſecretly, and that he ſhould ſo order them, that he might throwe them downe from aboue vpon the Emperours head as he was at praier, and ſo beat out his braines: which thing when he that was appointed to do ſo great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, did make haste to accompliſh, and ſought to laie an huge ſtone vpon the beames, with the weight thereof, the ſtone drew him downe, and the boorde being broken vnder the beames, both the ſtone, and the miſerable man by the iust iudgement of God, fell downe into the church floore, and by the ſame ſtone was he quite cruſhed to peeces. Of which fact after that the men of Rome knew, and of the order therof, they tied a rope to the wretches foot, &amp; cauſed him to be drawen three daies through the ſtreetes for the example of others. But the Emperour of his woonted clemencie cauſed him to be buried.</hi> Thus far goeth <hi>Benno.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:17967:16"/> Whence we vnderſtande how deteſtable the impietie of the pope was, who hauing no regard either of the place wherein the Emperour praied, and which the pope profeſſeth to be holie to himſelfe: nor of the time, wherein he praied, but ſeruing his blinde furie and madneſſe, ſought the deſtruction of the Emperour &amp; his prince. But go too, let vs cite another teſtimonie of impietie out of the ſame <hi>Benno. <hi>Iohn biſhop of Portua,</hi>
                  </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acquainted with Hildebrands ſecrets, went vp into Saint Peters pulpit, and amongst many things in the hearing of the cleargie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſaith, Hildebrand hath done ſome ſuch thing, for which we ought to be burned aliue: ſpeaking of the Sacrament of the Lords bodie, which Hildebrand, demaunding oracles from God against the Emperour, threw into the fire, though the cardinals his aſſistants did ſpeake against it.</hi> Theſe are the goodly teſtimonies of the papall pietie in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth. Now let vs cite another touching <hi>Sylueſter</hi> the ſeconde, out of the booke of <hi>Iohn Stella</hi> a Venetian, written vnto the patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> being cardinall prieſt of the church of Rome of the title of <hi>Saint Marke. <hi>Last of all</hi>
                  </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he was</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:17967:16"/> 
                  <hi>made pope of Rome through the deuill his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Yet vpon this condition, that after his death he ſhould be wholie his both in bodie and ſoule, by whoſe crafts he had attained vnto ſo great dignitie. After this Sylueſter asked him how long he ſhould liue pope? He anſwered, thou ſhalt liue vntill thou ſhalt ſay maſſe in Hieruſalem. Last of all, in the fourth yeere of his popedome, when as in the Lent-time in the ſolemne feast of the holie croſſe, he ſong maſſe in Hieruſalem at Rome, he knew foorthwith that he ſhould die by destiny. Wherefore repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe he confeſſed his fault before all the people: and he praied them all, that they would cut in quarters and peeces his body that was ſeduced by the deuils pollicie, and being cut and torne a ſunder, they would lay it in a cart, and that they woulde burie it there, whither the horſes ſhould carie it of their owne accord. Therefore they ſay that the horſes came by Gods prouidence (that wicked men may learne that there is place left for pardon with God, ſo they repent in this life) of their owne accorde to the church called Lateranenſis, and that he was buried there.</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Stella</hi> the Venetian. There is extant alſo a certaine ſermon made in the Eaſter time by <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> gouernour of the Vniuerſitie of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17967:17"/> Paris, wherin he left it written that pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij. did holde that the ſoules of the wicked are not in paine before the day of iudgement. Which hereſie of his the ſchoole of <hi>Sorbona</hi> in the ſame Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did ſtoutlie condemne, and cauſed that pope to recant his errour. Of the ſame ſort of impietie is that which we will ſet downe in the wordes of <hi>Raphaell Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane,</hi> out of his fift booke of <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,</hi> where ſpeaking of pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, whoſe name this our <hi>Quintus</hi> tooke, and whoſe godlines alſo he doth follow, he writeth thus: <hi>The pope being priuie and helping thereto, the conſpiratours come to Florence, and they meete all togither in the church of S. Reparata at the maſſe and ſacrifice in the morning. In the meane while Saluiatus departing the church priuilie with his confederates being armed, he goeth into the court, that he might ſpeake vnto the banner-bearer, feigning that he had ſome other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Yet to this end and purpoſe, that when the murder ſhould begin in the church, he might be preſent and readie to ſet vpon the court and magistrate. Therefore when the watch word was giuen, in the Eleuation time</hi> (marke the notable teſtimonie of the popes holines:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17967:17"/> The watch word, ſaith he, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time of the <hi>Eleuation) Bandinus did ſtick Iulian de Medicis brother to Laurence. Antonie, which was deſirous to be chiefe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon Laurence on the other ſide behinde his backe: and ſmote him a little below the throte. When as he forthwith turning himſelfe vnto crieng did auoide the ſtroke, he fled with ſpeed from him as he was about to ſtrike again, into the vestrie of the church that was neere to him. Then the popes ambaſſador</hi> (who gaue that watch word to commit the murder in the time of the Eleuation) <hi>being caught by the citizens, and led by them out of the church into the court, was committed to ward, and was handled as he had deſerued. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Saluiatus biſhop of Piſa, who of ſet purpoſe did protract his ſpeech with the banner-bearer, that he might ſee the ende, was foorthwith caught, and was the ſame day hanged vp at the court windowes: which meſſage when it came to the popes eares, he did excommunicate Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence de Medicis, who (as we haue ſaid) was faine to ſaue himſelfe by flieng, bicauſe he had laid hands on Gods priests and legate, and he proclaimed open war against the Florentines.</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Volateranus.</hi> Whereby euerie man may ſée, what great account
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17967:18"/> the popes vſe to make of their Euchariſt. And yet notwithſtanding they will haue all Chriſtian religion placed in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, carieng about, reuerencing, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring with all maner honor, the ſame. But we muſt bring foorth another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For what more certaine thing can be brought to ſhewe the impietie of the popes, than that which is common in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans mouth, that the order at Rome is, ſo often as the popes go on progreſſe, that that <hi>Eucharist</hi> being laid vpon ſome leane carrian iade, about whoſe necke a bel is hanged, is committed to ſome horſe-kéeper, and is ſent before amongſt the ſcul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and drudges, and other cariage, as a meſſenger to ſhew the pope was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. For in the booke of the popes ceremonies, 1. <hi>ſect. cap.</hi> 3. it is thus written. <hi>After them is led by a friend of the Sextins clothed in red, and carrieng a ſtaffe in his left hand, a white horſe, being gentle, carrieng the ſacrament of the Lords bodie, hauing about his necke a ſhrill little bell. Next after the ſacrament rideth the Sextin: who, as the other prelates, hath an horſe all couered with buckerom, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo <hi>ſect.</hi> 12. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>After them is led a white horſe trapped, gentle, and faire, hauing a ſhrill little</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17967:18"/> 
                  <hi>bell about his necke, which carrieth the coffer with the most holie bodie of the Lord.</hi> Alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Before the pope is alwaies carried the croſſe by the Subdeacon, and after the croſſe is carried the bodie of Christ vpon a white horſe with a little bell, &amp;c.</hi> And theſe are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the popes pompe, but they are but ordinances. For thoſe which frequent Rome, do with great conſent witnes both concerning the iade that is ſent before, and alſo touching the ſending of him amongſt other carriage. There is a booke extant written by <hi>Iohn Monlucius</hi> biſhop of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, who was often ſent ambaſſador to Rome for the king of France, which booke was written touching religion to Quéene mother: whoſe words are theſe *, being <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 101.</note> turned out of French into Latin; <hi>Quoties Papa, &amp;c. <hi>So often as the pope goeth on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, least he ſeeme to giue too much honor to his Eucharist, he doth not carrie it in his hands: but he ſendeth it away before him three or fower daies before he himſelfe goeth out of the citie, being laid vpon an horſes back, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſendeth to beare it companie, ſingers, mulitors, horſe-keepers, and other ſuch of his garde of his court, that is, cookes, kitchingboies, and curtiſans</hi>
                  </hi> (theſe are his words.) <hi>Then</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:17967:19"/> 
                  <hi>the pope who ſaith, that he is his vicar, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afterward garded and trouped with cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, biſhops, and other ſuch peeres. When he commeth to the towne, then that which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the bodie of Christ, which hath rested it ſelfe a while there, is brought out of the towne to meet him: and ſtraightway they ſalute one another by becking, ſaieng not one word. And then he ſendeth it before him againe: but with how great honor? The pope is carried into the citie vnder a rich canapie: the bodie of Christ is carried open. What need was there to bring that out of Rome, and to carrie it into another citie, ſeeing there is no pariſh that is not full of this ſort? What need is there to ſend it away three, fower, ſixe, ten daies before the popes comming? If the pope haue instituted that to this end, that it may be brought to meet him to accompanie him, and to ſet forth his entrance into the towne, there is no towne ſo ſimple or poore, where there are not ſuch bodies to bee found. If it must needs be brought out of Rome, why doth not the pope himſelfe bring it foorth, or at least giue commandement that it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him: rather than ſend it before him amongst packe horſes and his ſcullerie? But if for obtaining of rain (as they vſe to do at Paris, and in other places) they carrie the image of</hi>

                  <hi>any Saint or Sainteſſe from one church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they vſe to do it with great pompe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of men: they haue torches, banners, croſſes, and other ornaments borne before them. Nay for the most part thoſe which carrie thoſe images are naked, and only clad in linnen, or at least they go bare foote. And the pope will not be aſhamed to ſend that before him, which he will haue men to beleeue to be the bodie of Christ, with a little lanterne, and ſhut vp in a pixe, being laid vpon an horſe, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the riff raff of his court? Who wil think it to be a thing like to be true, that he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to be head of the church, would commit ſo great an offence, if he had verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the bodie of Ieſus Christ was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally vnder that ſacrament?</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Monlucius.</hi> Wherunto we may alſo adde that, which is approoued by the authoritie of many popes, and is openly receiued in the Romiſh church, out of the booke of the <hi>Conformities of S.

               <p>THe third argument of the popes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie remaineth. For although we haue both a forme of Chriſtian religion, and alſo to worſhip God, preſcribed both by Chriſt and alſo by his apoſtles, and though we haue the ſame deliuered vnto vs in the bookes of the new Teſtament, and God doth accurſe thoſe ſo often, which bring in feigned religions into the Church: yet the papacie hath brought in new inuentions of religion, ſo abſurd and rediculous, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17967:20"/> in ſo great calamitie we muſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding giue thankes to the immortall God, that he hath ſuffered ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to befall the dull wits alone. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of religions are theſe in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: firſt the innumerable troupes of Munks, as <hi>Auguſtinians, Battuti, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines, Bernardines, Carmelites, Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, Cartuſians, Caeleſtines, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, of ignorant Friers, Franciſcans, Hieronymitans, Maturines:</hi> of which euerye order hath his particular forme of cowléd gownes diſtinct from the reſt, and of diuers colors: euery one of them haue their proper and ſeuerall preſcript forms to worſhip their Gods, and (as they ſay in plaine words) their preſcript forms of their religion, their rites and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, far vnlike to the reſt. Yet there is ſuch a multitude of them, that in our Europe the number is thought to amount to fiue hundred thouſand. Which we may eaſily coniecture. For <hi>Sabellicus</hi> hath left in writing *, that the ſect of <hi>Franciſcans</hi> did <note place="margin">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17967:21"/> call them) and thréeſcore thouſand men. So that the maiſter of the whole order, which they call their generall, hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times béen heard promiſe the pope, at ſuch time as he was to ſet out an army againſt the Turke, of the familie of the Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Francis thirtie thouſand men of war, which coulde play their parts ſtoutly in the wars: without any hinderance of the holie ſeruice. Againe, their inuentions of miracles and doctrines are ſo falſe, that now the moſt of them are not onelie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but alſo aſhamed of ſo great follie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it ſéeme to be a thing like to be true in any mans iudgement at this time, that the vanitie of mankind was ſo great in times paſt, and that the darknes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was ſo great, vnleſſe there were proofes héerof extant more cléere than the ſunne. For no man in déed denieth, that amongſt the Romans, and other profane nations there were moſt abſurd inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religions: but ſillie men liued then in cruell and darke clouds, and as it were in a night when the moone ſhineth not, that is, without any moniments of holie ſcripture. But when as the ſame bookes of ſcripture were extant, where Chriſt gaue

For ſéeing this pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> came out of that crew and ſinke, we muſt ſée what maner forme of religion he bringeth vs out of that ſchoole. Therfore let be ranged in the firſt ranke that common oracle, which we wil prooue out of the booke of the Conformities of <hi>Francis,</hi> to be commonly receiued and approoued in the church of Rome, that <hi>Francis</hi> ſonne of <hi>Peter Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo,</hi> was in a trance conioined with Chriſt, and had as many ſtripes &amp; marks, and was pricked by Chriſt in the ſelfſame places, as Chriſt had when he hanged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe: and that for this cauſe he was called the <hi>Typicall Ieſus:</hi> that is, as it were a type and figure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified.

                  <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is the image of the father, ſo is <hi>Francis</hi> the image of Chriſt: finally, that Chriſt appéereth in the bodie of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> as the image in the glaſſe.

                  <hi>of the Minors, bicauſe they are girt with a plaine rope. Before Dominic was borne in the world, there appeered the images of two pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enece, in the church of S. Mark: the one whereof was like a religious man, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell of the order of the predicants, with a lilie in his hand. The other was like vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul, as he was woont to be painted: ouer which was written <hi>Agios Paulus,</hi> S. Paul, and vnder the feete of the picture, <hi>Per iſtum itur ad Chriſtum,</hi> by him men go to Christ: vnder the other picture was written, <hi>Agios Dominicus,</hi> S. Dominic, and vnder him, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliùs itur per iſtum,</hi> men go more eaſily by him. And woonder not at this writing, bicauſe the doctrine of Paul as of the other Apostles, was a doctrine leading vnto faith. The doctrine of Dominic, a doctrine leading to the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Counſels, and therefore men go more eaſily by him vnto Christ.</hi> 2. <hi>The Lord was borne vpon the bare ground, but least the colde ſhould hurt him too much, he is placed in a manger by his mother the virgin. When Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic was borne being but a little one, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the keeping of his nurſe, he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found gone out of his bed, and lieng naked vpon the ground, as if he did alreadie abhor the pleaſures of the fleſh.</hi> 3. <hi>When the Lord was</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:17967:30"/> 
                  <hi>borne there appeered a bright ſtar, which gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the wiſe men vnto him, inſinuating that the whole world ſhould be illuminate by him. Dominic aroſe, and vpon him when he was to be baptiſed, his ſpirituall mother ſaw a ſtar in his forehead, foreſhewing a new ſunne beame of the world.</hi> 4. <hi>The Lord being twelue yeere old was brought by his parents into the temple, and there he remained alone being but a boy. Dominic was caried by the neighbors into the church in his tender yeeres to be put in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine office, there was he left.</hi> 5. <hi>From that time vntill the time of his youth we finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing authentically of the Lord, ſaue onely that he increaſed in age, as being true man, in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and fauor with God and men: but this outwardly. But Dominic did not onely increaſe in bodie, but alſo in mind effectually.</hi> 6. <hi>When the Lord was baptiſed by Iohn in Iordan, the holie Ghost came downe in a doue vpon him, to betoken the fulnes of grace, and he went into the wildernes. When Dominic ſaw the famine increaſe in all parts of Spaine, and ſaw alſo that there were many that were in neceſſitie, and that they had no comforter: in feruencie of ſpirit he ſold his bookes and ſtuffe, and diſperſed and gaue the price thereof to the poore, and newly and apparently repleniſhed as it were</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:17967:30"/> 
                  <hi>with the holie Ghost, he did ſtreightway betake himſelfe to the rule vnder Didacus the biſhop, as another baptiſme and ſpiritual deſert, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from pleaſures and worldly vanities.</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord doth afterward gather togither a few diſciples; and in a ſhort ſpace multiplieth them, ſending them two and two to preach the kingdome of God. Dominic taking with him but a few to lead a religious life, had afterward a great number, whom he appointed to preach the Goſpell, and to heale the ſick.</hi> 8. <hi>The Lord choſe pouertie in himſelfe and in his Apostles: but he had bags to keepe thoſe things that the faithfull did giue, and theſe did Iudas carie: but Dominic was a true louer of pouertie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his brethren to the ſame.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord when he led his diſciples, they were ſo hungrie, that paſſing through the fields they plucked the eares of the corne, they rubbed them in their hands, to eate them: and when it was now noone, being wearie of his iournie, he ſent them into Sychar to buy meate, and they eate therof by chance ſometimes with vnwaſhen hands. Touching the qualitie of the meate, it is verily beleeued, that they did eate no fleſh, but the Paſchal lamb for the keeping of the law. The patriarke Dominic, who ſpent ſometimes the whole Lent, not onelie without meate, but alſo</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:17967:31"/> 
                  <hi>without bread and water, did moderate this ſharpnes in his diſciples, giuing them leaue to drink wine, and to eate white meates.</hi> 10. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome man will ſaie that it agreeth not with the ſimilitude, that the Lord ſaid to his diſciples, Neither ſhall you haue ſhooes on your feete: whereas notwithstanding Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic and his go ſhod when they go abroad. But we muſt know that that was a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during but for a time, for which he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a diſpenſation at his last ſupper. For we may ſee that both the Lord did weare ſhooes, in that which the Baptiſt ſaith, whoſe ſhoo latchet I am not worthy to looſe; and alſo it was ſaid to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Acts, Take thine hoſe: vnleſſe ſome man ſay that he did weare hoſe, but no ſhooes: which was not commonly uſed. And Marke a good imitator of him, gaue a cobler his ſhoo to mende when it was broken. So that the Lorde and his diſciples went ſometimes ſhod, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times barefoote. And ſo Dominic was ſhod when he was in cities, but in his iourney he was oftentimes barefoote.</hi> 11. <hi>When the Lorde was borne, none other perſon but his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marie the virgin, did wrap him in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling clouts: and when he was growne vp his mother hir-ſelfe with hir owne hands woue him his coate without ſeame, and his other</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17967:31"/> 
                  <hi>garments: but of what colour it was we finde not, namely, least if it were knowne, falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould weare the like, and ſo ſhould not be knowne to be rauening woolues. The moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgine Marie ſhewed Dominic and his order what apparell they ſhould weare, and alſo the colour thereof. For ſhe appeered to S. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold when he was ſore ſicke, and healed him, ſhewing him the garment which S. Dominic and his ſonnes ſhould weare: namelie a great cope, and a coat with a cowle, al white.</hi> 12. <hi>The Lord and Dominic being both virgins in mind and bodie, and verie humble, as the ſcripture doth witnes: ſo Dominic was a most pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and verie humble.</hi> 13. <hi>Dominic as alſo Christ did not poſſeſſe his owne bed, ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his bodie on the grounde after his flood of teares.</hi> 14. <hi>The Lords praier was alwaies heard, when he would, for which cauſe he ſaid to the father, I knewe that thou hearest me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: for though he were not heard in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when he praied that the cup might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him: this came to paſſe therefore, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in aſmuch he asked according to ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, he would not be heard, according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But Dominic tolde a certaine religious man in the Lords words, who was verie famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with him, that he did neuer ask any thing of</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:17967:32"/> 
                  <hi>God, but he did obtaine it according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi> 15. <hi>The Lord by his owne example did dedicate his Apostles to a mixed life, that is a contemplatiue and actiue in preaching: the virgin his mother and Magdalene to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue. For Marie ſtood at the feet of the Lord, and heard his word. Lu.</hi> 10. <hi>But Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha and the other women to an actiue. So the Patriark Dominic, like to another Noe, made the arke of his religion, which was made of wood glued togither with the morter of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing three roofes or loftes. Placing his brethren togither with him in one, to beholde heauenly things, and to preach the mysteries of ſaluation; taking to him the nunnes that were ſhut vp to contemplation: in the ſecond apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both men and women to the actiue life; and in the thirde manſion bestowing the brethren and ſisters which were called of the repentance of Ieſus, or the warrefare of Ieſus Christ.</hi> 16. <hi>There departed</hi> 72. <hi>diſciples from Chriſt, being offended at the doctrine of Christ which they vnderstood not: who when they departed, Christ asked thoſe that remained with him, will you alſo depart? But Peter anſwered in the name of them all, Lord to whom ſhal we go? And S. Dominic, when he had with him ſome diſciples, being one day tempted they departed</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17967:32"/> 
                  <hi>from him: onely there ſtaied three behinde; to which Dominic alſo ſaid; will you alſo depart? To whom one made anſwere, God forbid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that forſaking the head we follow the feet. At length as the diſciples of Chriſt which went away, returned to him againe, ſo alſo the diſciples of Dominic returned to him through his praier.</hi> 17. <hi>The Lord did valiantly beare euen vntill death, many mockes, ſlanders, and perſecutions, of thoſe that ſought to intrap him in his words, ſometimes to ſtone him, ſomtimes to breake his necke. Dominic did not regard ſcoffings, reproches, &amp; ſpeakings against: ſo that one did bind ſtubble vpon his back in mockerie: others did cast dirt and other vile things at him.</hi> 18. <hi>The Lord loued vs, and waſhed vs from our ſinnes in his blood. And Dominic being not void of the perfection of charitie, did bestow the night in Gods ſeruice, giuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to meditation and praier: he did execute a threefold diſcipline as it were daily with his owne hand, not with a cord, but with an iron chaine, till the blood came: one for his owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which were the least: another for thoſe that were in purgatorie: the third for thoſe that are conuerſant in the world.</hi> 19. <hi>When the Lord iournied toward Hieruſalem, when he ſaw the citie, he wept ouer it, and he foretold</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:17967:33"/> 
                  <hi>many ſecrets of harts, and euents of things to come, for which it was ſaid in his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, A great prophet is riſen vp amongst vs. When Dominic drew neere to cities, beholding in mind, he wept bitterly for their ſinnes, and he reuealed manie hid and ſecret things as a true prophet: as the death of the king of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in battell: the conuerſion of the heretike Adiu that was to come, whom he therfore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſaued from burning.</hi> Thus far goeth <hi>Antoninus:</hi> whereby the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the moſt mightie king of France may iudge, whether the moſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome haue iuſtly or vniuſtly reiected theſe inuentions of religion brought in by the popes: ſéeing they durſt ſo wickedly and heinouſly ſet <hi>Dominic</hi> the munke to be worſhipped in the church of God for an idoll, and to match him with Chriſt being God &amp; our ſauior. For we muſt not giue eare to him that ſhall ſaie that theſe are onelie munkiſh toies, which graue and learned men do loath. For that which we ſaid before touching the Franciſcane ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the ſame ſort, do we ſaie in this place of the Dominicans: ſéeing they are receiued for diuine oracles in the church of Rome, that all Chriſtians muſt either
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17967:33"/> worſhip them, or elſe they muſt looke for ſuch puniſhments as are appointed for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, by this gallowes, cowled, and cord bearing frier. But now let vs heare ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe. It ſéemeth that nothing can be added to this impietie. But yet let vs trie what can be done. For the ſame <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the chapter following where he compareth the miracles of Chriſt and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic</hi> togither, ſaith thus: <hi>Dominic raiſed</hi>

                  <hi>three from death in the citie of Rome, the ſonne of the widow, which being knowne to the pope he would haue publiſhed it: but Dominic for humilitie did vtterly refuſe it. The carpenter that was hired by his brethren, and cruſhed in peeces by a wall that fell vpon him: and Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poleon the cardinall of the new ditch his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, which fell from an horſe, and was all rent in peeces.

This power was not a little imparted to Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, of things in heauen, in earth, and in hel. For he had the holie Angels to wait vpon him.

What ſhall I ſpeake of the infernall ſpirits? Surely the diuels did tremble at his becke, neither were they able to refuſe his power. Which appeereth: when he led him with him as he appeered in the ſhape of a frier, through the aſſemblies of the conuent, namely, of the Dormitall, quire, fratry, locutorie, and afterward of the chapter-houſe, and he asked him of euery place, what he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there with the friers? All which he was enforced to declare.</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> By which we leaue it to the kings Counſellers to be iudged, whether this be

Surely we hope that no man doubteth, but that the pope is already conuict moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of falſe and forged religions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he excommunicate the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> out of the communion of his Church, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth theſe monſters, he doth not exclude them out of the Church of Chriſt, but out of the iakes of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or rather out of the ſynagog of ſatan. Which thing that it may more plainly and firmely be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, we will cite out of the ſame <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a like inuention of the popiſh church.

Whoſe wrath when no man could reſist, the mild vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his mother met him, and imbracing his feet, beſought him that he would ſpare thoſe whom he had redeemed, and that he would temper his iustice with mercie.

Who ſaid: Bicauſe I ſee in the preſence of thy glory men of al religions: but of the ſons of mine order (alas for wo) I ſee here none. To whom the Lord ſaid: Wilt thou ſee thine order? But he ſaid: That is my deſire Lord. Then the ſonne putting his hand vnder his mother the virgins cloke, he ſaid to him: I haue committed thine order to my mother. And when he continued in this godlie affection, deſiring to ſee his order, the Lord ſaid to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Wouldest thou ſo gadly ſee them?

For as they did oftentimes profeſſe before, and at this day they do profeſſe, ſo much as in them lieth, before all ſortes and orders of men, yea they do openly denounce, ſéeing the church of Rome hath religion mixed and confuſed with ſuch inuentions and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, thoſe things which are drawne out of the pure fountaines of Scripture, thoſe do they moſt carefullie embrace: thoſe things which are brought in into religion out of theſe munkiſh pits &amp; filthy ſinks, doe they reiect and deteſt. And yet this is the onely cauſe why pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift hath ſo proudly &amp; cruelly curſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. Of which pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> it ſéemeth good to me to ſpeake ſomewhat in this place, that all men may perceiue both what manner of man he is, and alſo from what roots he ſprang to ſuch pride, and became ſo hawtie. Therfore his firſt name was <hi>Felix Peretus.</hi> He was borne in a baſe village nigh to <hi>Formana,</hi> called <hi>Montalto:</hi> in the yéere 1521. the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17967:38"/> thirtéenth day of December. Being a boy he was brought vp among munkes, that is (not to ſay any more) among goate buckes, at length being a yoong man, hée was choſen into the order of the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes:</hi> vnto whoſe holie rites after hée was admitted, &amp; now growne vp, he was at laſt choſen by the inquiſitours of the Romiſh faith into their colledge. Which office when he did ſo execute a fewe yéeres ago, that few could abide his cruel nature, it fell out ſo by hap at that time, that he called a certaine noble man of Venece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. When he did more cruelly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the man vnacquainted with hearing reproches: not many daies after he met the ſame noble man by chance: whom ſo ſoone as the ſame noble man perceiued, he commanded one of his waiters to beate downe with a cudgell he had in his hand, the pride of vnfortunate <hi>Peretus.</hi> The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate man who of <hi>Felix</hi> was become <hi>Infelix,</hi> went ſtraightway to Rome, and tolde pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, who was then high gouernour at Rome. The pope being highly diſpleaſed ſendeth him back againe to Venece with greater authoritie and power. So ſoone as he ſhewed the ſenate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17967:39"/> his bull, the wiſe men which knew ful wel the troubleſome nature of the man, and how that he was inflamed with deſire of reuenge, commanded foorth-with a torche to be lighted: and did ſtraightly command him, that before the torch was burnt, he ſhoulde get him with ſpéede out of their coaſtes if he were wiſe. <hi>Infelix</hi> going to Rome againe, made his complaint to the pope. When the pope perceiued that he was a man moſt fit for his purpoſe, he did firſt aduance him to this honor, that he made him maſter of his pallace: that done when <hi>Toledanus</hi> the archbiſhop, one of the ſpaniſh inquiſition which is fearefull to all nations, was ſuſpected of hereſie, the pope ſent him into Spaine, that he might be preſent at that queſtion &amp; iudgement. It happened by chance at that time, that he that was then generall, that is, chiefe prelate of the <hi>Franciſcanes,</hi> (which is the higheſt office and dignitie of that ſorte of men) died. Which inheritance the pope gaue to <hi>Felix Peretus:</hi> who by this means was made the archcowled, chiefe cowled, and cloaked cowled frier of that order of <hi>Franciſcanes:</hi> and a few yéeres after he was alſo choſen cardinall by the ſame

At length when pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. was dead, our archcowling <hi>Felix</hi> was choſen into his roome, in troubling France by his commendation and fauour, who is chiefe at Rome in furthering theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and whom he doth plainely aide in holding the reſidue of the kingdome of Nauarre. By theſe degrées &amp; procéedings, he which a fewe yéeres ago was a cowled, a roped, a moſt vile frier créeping in his ſlitted ſhooes, is now become a thunderer, a thunderbolt caſter, an excommunicator of kings and princes,</p>

For no biſhop hath his cauſe from <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other Apoſtle: but from the choice made by the authoritie of Chriſt: neither doth the place, ſea, or chaire make the ſucceſſion, but the continuance of the doctrine of Chriſt: when as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion receiued of Chriſt, is continually deliuered by all the ſucceſſors as by hands to the Chriſtian people. Wherefore thoſe new ſhifts of certaine of the popes clawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs make nothing againſt vs, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mooued by hope of ſome benefice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thus: that the pope of Rome is not the ſpirituall head of the catholike church, but the miniſteriall: bicauſe like as Chriſt doth gouerne particular churches (that is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17967:44"/> particular dioces) by particular biſhops his vicars: in like ſort the ſame Chriſt doth gouerne his vniuerſall Church by ſome one vniuerſall vicar of his, namely, the pope of Rome: who kéepeth in doing their duty thoſe inferior and particular biſhops, that are ſubiect to his iuriſdiction. For we anſwere this obiection thrée manner of waies. Firſt, that this principalitie is not onely not ordained of Chriſt, but alſo that it is brought in by the pope of Rome by ambition and deſire to lord it. For when Chriſt ſent his twelue Apoſtles about to preach his Goſpell, he gaue not to ſom one ſome ſingular and principall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the like &amp; one to them all: thus, <hi>Go ye into all coasts of the earth, and preach the Goſpell among all people and nations.</hi> And therefore in the Reuelation the heauenlie Ieruſalem is not ſaid to be founded vpon one and a particular piller, or eſpecially vpon one of all the reſt, but ſimplie vpon twelue: and when as vpon the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi> the holie Ghoſt was powred out vppon the twelue Apoſtles, he was not powred out vpon ſome one of them eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and chiefly, but he was ſimply powred out vpon all. Laſt of all, when <hi>Paul</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17967:44"/> the functions and offices of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, he doth not giue to any one the principalitie or lordſhip ouer the reſt, but he expoundeth to them the ſame in plaine words: <hi>Christ is gone vp on high, he hath led captiuitie captiue, and hath giuen gifts to men. For he hath made ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euangelists, ſome pastors, and teachers, for the restoring of the Saints, for the worke of the ministerie to the edifieng of the bodie of Christ.</hi> The other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that if Chriſt or <hi>Peter</hi> had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any principalitie, and one miniſteriall head in his Church, no doubt the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church would haue retained that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance being ſo freſh in memorie. But on the contrarie we ſée that the moſt ancient generall Synods of all, namely, the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi> that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> did ordaine that ouer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery citie ſhould be appointed a biſhop: that done, that euery prouince ſhould haue an Archbiſhop or patriarke, hauing all like dignitie, authoritie, iuriſdiction, power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée: beſides, that it was granted to the Archbiſhop of Rome, that for the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and honor of the city, he ſhould ſit in the firſt place, but yet not in an higher place:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17967:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> and next him ſhould ſit the Archbiſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the ſelfe-ſame cauſe, bicauſe he was biſhop of new Rome, being the emperors citie: wheras if they had had regard of the more ancient Church, that firſt, or elſe the ſecond place ſhuld haue béen due to the biſhop of <hi>Antiochia:</hi> &amp; then the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the thrée archbiſhops of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> made by the emperor <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> for moſt light cauſes, ſhuld take place in like ſeats: which cauſes we will ſhew afterward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crime of forgerie: where we will reckon vp the forgeries, coſſenages, and corruptions deuiſed by the pope of Rome to fill vp this his ambition. The third an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that ſéeing Chriſt did appoint his Apoſtles to be meſſengers and preachers of his commandements to go throughout diuers coaſts of the earth, we read not that any one of them was appointed to be an Archmeſſenger: eſpecially to be mute and to be at eaſe, that he might lie buſking and loitering at Rome, and harken after thoſe things that were done in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world whereſoeuer, and might in the meane ſeaſon ſerue his ambition. For biſhops are nothing elſe but meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17967:45"/> of Chriſt, and proclaimers of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ordained in euery citie: like as in times paſt, the emperors of Rome were woont to giue things in charge to the <hi>Proconſuls</hi> and <hi>Preſidents,</hi> as all thoſe that are ſtudents of the law and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Romans do affirme. Therefore he that is dumbe either by nature or will, that is, he that kéepeth ſilence, and doth not execute the office of a meſſenger &amp; herald, and doth not preach the Goſpell, he is not only not woorthy of the authoritie, but not ſo much as of the name of biſhop or arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop. But bicauſe the popes in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals do in euery third line inculcate that ſong: <hi>Bicauſe it was ſaid to Peter, Feede my ſheepe, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rocke: it is woorth the paines to ſet downe the true and naturall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of thoſe places. For Augustine in his</hi> 124. <hi>tract. vpon Iohn: When (ſaith he) it was ſaid to Peter, I will giue thee the keies of the kingdome of heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bind vpon earth: he ment the vniuerſal church that is founded vpon the rocke. From whence euen Peter tooke his name. For the rocke was not called Petra of Peter, but Peter of Petra or the rocke: as Christ tooke not his name of Christians, but Christians of Christ. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:17967:46"/> 
                  <hi>the Lord ſaith, Vpon this rocke will I build my Church, bicauſe Peter had ſaid, Thou art Christ the ſonne of the liuing God. Therefore vpon this rocke,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, will I build my Church. For Christ was the rocke, vpon which foundation euen Peter himſelfe was builded. For no man can lay any other foundation than that which is alreadie laid, which is Ieſus. Therefore the Church that is founded in Christ, receiueth from him the keies of the kingdome of heauen in Peter: that is, power to bind and looſe ſinnes. For the ſame which Christ is in the Church by propertie, the ſame is Peter in the rocke by ſignification: by which ſignification is vnderstood Christ the rocke: Peter the Church.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> which thing he repeateth in his book againſt <hi>Iud. paga.</hi> And alſo in the tenth tract vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of the word of the Lord, <hi>ſer.</hi> 20.

For we haue ſhewed that the Dominicane friers onlie are placed vnder the mantle of the bleſſed virgin.

Whereof this is the firſt teſtimonie. The holie Scripture teacheth vs, that there is one onely forme of religion and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, the ſame which is ſet downe in writing, in the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apoſtles: ſo that it is not lawfull to adde any thing thereto, or to take any thing there fro: no, not for an Angell in heauen. Therefore Chriſt ſaith: <hi>In vaine do they worſhip me, teaching doctrines which</hi>

And firſt of all let vs cite that: The pope vſeth vpon a certaine and ſet day to make certaine little images like to a lamb, of white wax tempered with oile. He affirmeth that theſe, if they be hoong about the neck, do in like ſort purge mens ſinnes, euen as the blood of Chriſt doth purge them: he affirmeth that they driue away lightening, that they helpe women in childbirth, and that they ſaue men from burning, and ſhipwrack. What more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing can be ſpoken or thought vpon. But theſe are called the traditions of the elders, deliuered to this pope by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors as from hand to hand. For in the booke of the popes Ceremonies it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thus:</p>

                  <l>It breaketh ſinne like Christs owne blood,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Let this then be the firſt tradition of the popes, which is deliuered to vs with like &amp; the ſame authoritie as the holie ſcripture. There followeth another: The holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs that the ſacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt Ieſus for the remiſſion of our ſins, and the <note place="margin">

But the popes traditions doe grant baptiſme to bels: and the prieſts of the papacie do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe ſo great a ſacrament euery where ſo wickedly, and vngodlily, that the emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt wrote a complaint concerning that matter, which is extant among his <hi>grauamina</hi> or burdenings in theſe words: <hi>Alſo the ſuffragans haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, that they alone, and none other priest, ſhould baptiſe bels.

                  </hi> ſaith excellently and cléerly. But as the ſow in wallowing, ſo are the popes delighted in this filth and corruption. And concerning this moſt filthy cuſtomary pollution of the <note place="margin">

And theſe men will not thinke thoſe to be guiltie that giue the honor of the name of God to a creature, and forſaking the Lord do worſhip their fellow ſeruants: as if they could</hi>

But to pleaſe and intreat God, who is ignorant of nothing (for he knoweth all mens merits) we need no ſpokes-man: but a deuout mind. For whereſoeuer ſuch a one ſhall ſpeake, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer nothing at all.</hi> This ſaith <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> What? How religiouſly doth the papacie kéepe this ordinance of the holie ſcripture and the old Church? It denieth that there did euer any ſaint depart this life, which was receiued into the place of the bleſſed, which doth not execute the office of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and interceſſor.

               <p>HItherto haue we ſpoken of the ſecond crime of the papacie. Hereafter order doth require that we intreate of ſacrilege, and of that wickednes which commonlie they all <hi>Simonie,</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> For it is manifeſt that at Rome the pope kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two ſimonie markes, of thoſe thinges which they call ſpirituall. One is that, wherein benefices are openly ſold without any diſſimulation, and that is the moſt gainefull. Another being not ſo gainefull, but notwithſtanding filthy &amp; deteſtable, is that, which is called the tax of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17967:55"/> penance, when as impunitie of all ſin and wickednes is ſo manifeſtly ſold, euery ſin hauing a certaine ſum of money ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, that euen ſome canoniſts do deteſt that vnſatiable couetouſnes, and robbery.

And ſurely ſo it is, that yéerely an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible weight of gold is caried to Rome out of the moſt wealthy treaſuries in the world, which the popes and cardinals and other epicures of the ſame order doe ſpend vpon the moſt inſatiable and bottomleſſe gulfe of their luſtes, with great infamie of the name of Chriſtians. The names and titles of the former are infinite: but of ſo great ſtore theſe are chiefely reckoned. The tribute of firſt fruites or vacances: which is the name of the reuenues of the firſt yéere, which the popes gather into their treaſurie: but theſe are for the moſt part doubled, and tripled. Alſo the tribute of preuentions, reſignations for fauour, commendations, diſpenſations for age, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, irregularitie, corporall faultes. Alſo of expectatiue graces, deuolutions, benefices that are like to be void, priuileges, exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17967:56"/> for not viſiting, or to viſit by a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of confeſſions of thoſe that are agréed, of tranſactions made vnder the popes good pleaſure, of changinges of benefices with diſpenſation, of mandates of biſhops, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions in form by reaſon of congruitie, for making notories and protonotories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike, with their coadiutors: for letters of greater or leſſer iuſtice, for ſecular dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, for dignities eccleſiaſticall, for new foundations, or changing the old, or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of regular monaſteries into ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtate, or for reſtoring them againe, for receiuing fruites during abſence, for legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, portable altars, for non obſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for indulgences of ſecular clerks, for reuocations, and reductions, for <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or tollerances of concubines, and for reſcriptions to ſuites. Time ſhould faile vs if we ſhould go about to reckon vp all ſorts of their vnlawfull ſcrapings and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries. Neither is it greatlie néedfull. For there is a booke of the popes extant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters &amp; markets, hauing this title: <hi>The taxes of the Apoſtolike chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with the Notables, as they write them at this day, of the church of Rome:</hi> in which booke there is a woorthy ſaieng expreſſed in theſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17967:56"/> words in a certaine place: <hi>And note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that ſuch graces and diſpenſations are not granted to poore men: bicauſe they are not: therefore they cannot be comforted.</hi> Who is he that is ſo ſecure a contemner of God: who is he altogither ſo voide of conſcience amongſt the kings counſailers, whom theſe monſters of robberies, ſacrileges, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies do not mooue?

That which we are now about to ſay, will ſéem a thing incredible, but yet it is certaine and tried to be true. When as in times paſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane empire ſtoode, there was ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth and riches, ſo great ſtore of gold and ſiluer caried thither out of all partes and places of the world, of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and taxes of all people and nations in a maner, that, that citie was commonly called by the Gréeke word: <hi>The little Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie</hi>

                  <hi>of the whole world.</hi> What if we now ſhew that the pope of Rome doth draw to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17967:57"/> Rome yéerely by his ſhifts, coſenage, and wicked policies, out of Europe onelie, (which is counted but the third part of the world) no leſſe ſtore of gold and ſiluer, than the emperors of Rome did exact of all coaſtes of the earth for ſo many legions that lay euerie-where in gariſon? Let vs heare <hi>Flauius Blondus</hi> his teſtimonie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man that was an Italian, &amp; a great flatterer of the popes, out of his booke of Rome reſtored 3. <hi>Now (ſaith he) the princes of the world do adore and worſhip the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dictator, not of Caeſar, but the ſucceſſor of Peter the fiſherman, and the vicar of the foreſaid emperour, the chiefe and high biſhop. Now the whole world doth worſhip the ſenate of cardinals in Rome, next to the pope. What? That almost all Europe ſendeth to Rome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes being greater then, at least equall with the tributes of ancient times, when euery citie receiueth from the pope of Rome benefices for priestes?</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Blondus.</hi> But we muſt a little more diligently frame the reaſon of this cruel ſacrilege. For <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> writeth thus: <hi>He brought all France into the forme of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and he laid vpon the ſame yeerely foure hundred ſesterties by the name of a ſtipende.</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:17967:57"/> 
                  <hi>Eutropius</hi> left this ſame written in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in as many words in the ſixt booke of his breuiarie. If we folow <hi>William Bude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his account we ſhal find that this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeſterties is in our coin, ten hundred thouſand crownes: or as they commonly cal it, a million: as the Germanes vſe it, ten tuns of gold. This was a great tribute for France: which it did yéerely pay to the emperours in ſuch ſort, that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there was paide out of the ſame to ſome legions that lay in gariſon, a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende. What if we now prooue that the pope of Rome doth with his iuglings and ſhifts gather to Rome yéerly no leſſe ſum, without paieng any thing out of the ſame? Peraduenture it wil ſéeme to ſom a thing incredible, and altogither monſterous: as I ſaide before: but yet notwithſtanding we ſhall prooue by a moſt ſure teſtimonie that it is moſt true. Who is then a witnes of that ſo great robberie or rather ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege? The ſenate of Paris that beareth chiefe rule in France, which about an hundred yéeres ago, preſented to <hi>Ludoui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the eleuenth, certaine requeſts for the churches of France, which <hi>Francis Dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> a lawyer tranſlated into Latine, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17967:58"/> publiſhed with the kings priuilege, twiſe at Paris, and alſo twiſe at Lyons: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the booke concerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. For in the 72. article of the ſame requeſts, it is thus written: <hi>That we may ſpeciallie and particularly ſhew how greatly the money of the realme is wasted within thoſe three yeeres, we must marke, that in the holie biſhops time there haue bin void in this realme more than twentie archbiſhoprikes, and biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes: and it is not to be doubted, but that as well for the yeerely tribute which we call the first fruits, as for other extraordinarie costes vpon euerie bull, there haue bin paide downe ſixe thouſand crownes, which ſum amounteth to an hundred and twentie thouſand crownes.</hi> The 68. article followeth: <hi>There haue bin voide in this realme threeſcore abbots places: whereof euerie one cost two thouſand crownes at the least: therefore the ſum is an hundred and twentie thouſand crownes.</hi> 74. <hi>At the ſame time there were voide priorſhips, deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, prouostſhips, masterſhips, and other dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which haue not the paſtorall ſtaffe for their inſigne, more than two hundred: and for euerie one of theſe benefices there were paide downe, fiue hundred crownes: the ſumme therefore is, an hundred thouſand crownes.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:17967:58"/> 75. <hi>It is manifeſt that in this realme there be at least an hundred thouſand pariſhes, which are inhabited and repleniſhed. Neither is there any one wherein at that time ſome one did not obtaine an expectatiue grace: and for euerie one of theſe they paied fiue and twentie crowns, as well for the charges of the iournie, as for the making of the buls: non obstances, preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, annullations, and other eſpeciall clauſes, which were woont to be adioined to the graces expectatiues. Alſo for the executorie proceſſe vpon the ſame graces. This ſumme is twentie times fiue hundred thouſand crownes.</hi> Thus ſaith the Senate of Paris. Now let vs col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the totall ſumme of the ſummes. We ſhall find that it amounteth to the ſumme of nine hundred ſix and fortie thouſand ſix hundred thréeſcore and ſix crownes, and moreouer to the eight part of one crowne: which is the third part of that ſum which the Senate of Paris ſheweth to haue béen caried to Rome in that thrée yéeres ſpace: namely, eight and twentie hundred and fortie thouſand crowns: or to ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our countrie ſpéech, thrée millions of gold lacking an hundred &amp; thréeſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: or (as the <hi>Germans</hi> ſay) almoſt eight and twentie tunnes of gold. Moreouer, we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17967:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue found out that the taxe of the vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons written in the bookes of the treaſure-houſe of the cathedrall churches and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baies of France, being taxed onely; doth euery ſixt yéere amount to the ſumme of ſix hundred, ninetie ſeuen thouſand, ſeuen hundred and fiftie French pounds, beſides the prelacies and other benefices that are not taxed, the exactions whereof do almoſt ariſe to that ſumme. And ſhal there be any in the kings Parleament of France, that will confeſſe that he can with a quiet mind ſuffer this whirlepit, or rather <hi>Scylla, Charibdis,</hi> or gulfe? And will not rather ſo ſoone as he heareth this loſſe of ſo great ſummes, deteſt and accurſe that huge and cruell beaſt with all praiers? And yet we will not cite this teſtimonie onely. Lo we haue another out of the booke whoſe title is, <hi>The Foreſt of common places,</hi> which was publiſhed about the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell holden at Baſill, wherein is gathered into a groſſe ſumme, the ſumme of monie that during the time of pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifts popedome, was caried to Rome out of France alone, which is ſaide to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to ninetie hundred thouſande crownes. And do we woonder that that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17967:59"/> ſame Senate of Paris, did in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, <hi>artic.</hi> 71. ſore and bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that ſo great a ſumme of gold and ſiluer was yéerely caried to Rome, ſo that they were compelled ſomtimes for the vſe of the common people of France to coine braſſe monie for ſiluer monie? But let vs heare the 62. article of the ſame requeſts. <hi>Heertofore</hi> (ſaith the Senate of Paris) <hi>the people of this kingdome ran to Rome by heapes, whereof ſome ſerued the cardinals and courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: ſome being ſeruants to no man, but being intiſed by ſome vaine hope, did ſpend their owne and their parents ſubstance: other ſome, and that a great manie went to Rome for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they might procure trouble to the rest that ſtaied heere, and that they might wring out of their hands by hooke or by crooke their churches and benefices. For we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the greatest part of thoſe which went hence to Rome, was woont to die ſtraightway either through weariſomnes and danger of the iournie, or through the plague, which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very rife at Rome: and thoſe which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of theſe dangers, they procured trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to old men, ſicke perſons, and to ſuch like, which were continually reſident in their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and benefices. But it did oftentimes fall</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:17967:60"/> 
                  <hi>out, that ſilly men being cited to the court of Rome, when as they could not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues against theſe falſe accuſers, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to end their life through weariſomnes and ſorrow.</hi> 62. <hi>Most of thoſe that did hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefices, did quite emptie their parents and friends bagges, and at length, they were brought to great pouertie and beggerie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they indure ſo great iniuries vpon any other hope, ſaue onely that they might ſomtimes bring home lead for gold: and it fell out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that the gaping crow was deceiued, and that the lead that was bought with gold, was nothing elſe but lead. For whiles they trusted to their leaden buls, there came in one between, which brought at a ſudden an annullation: and ſometimes there were ten or twelue that did gape and catch for one benefice. And when the ſtrife was once begun, they must backe againe to Rome to follow the ſute: ſo that whiles all men ran to Rome from all quarters, the realme was miſerably destitute of hir people and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</hi> And this ſurely was the complaint of the Senate of Paris, of the vnſatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, and gréedie robberie of the popes, aboue an hundred yéeres ago, which was preſented to king <hi>Ludouike,</hi> and yet not ſproong from the new and freſh robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17967:60"/> of the popes. For there is extant a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of that <hi>Ludouike</hi> that was called <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, anno</hi> 1228. which doth plainly ſhew how great the couetouſnes of the popes was in France euen at that time: <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions</hi>

Not deuotion, or a pure conſcience doth draw men vnto thee, but the committing of many heinous facts, and the deciding of controuerſies gotten by monie.</hi> Let vs alſo heare the complaint of <hi>Theodore Nihemius</hi> being not vnlike <note place="margin">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17967:69"/> which manie hiſtoriographers haue recorded touching the emperor <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike Ahenobarbus:</hi> and amongſt theſe <hi>Helmodus</hi> in the eight chapter of <hi>Scl. Chronic.</hi> 1. <hi>Naucler. generat.</hi> 39. <hi>Barnus</hi> of the life of popes. When he and pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> were agréed togither, that he ſhould giue to the pope as great reuerence as he could, as to S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: finally, that when he did alight, he ſhould hold his ſtirrop, it is ſaid that the emperor ſtood on his right ſide, and touched the right ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop. Wherat the pope was diſpleaſed, and reprooued the emperor: but he anſwered him, that he did it, bicauſe he knew not what the holding of ſtirrops meant, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was the firſt time that euer he held any. Which things ſéeing they are ſo, and the pope hath taken to himſelfe ſo great lordſhip ouer the moſt mightie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world, yet it is pleaſant to heare, that our pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift doth call that lordſhip by the name of <hi>ſeruice.</hi> For in the beginning of his declaration againſt the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> he vſeth theſe words: That he doth therefore excommunicate the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> that during the time of his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:17967:69"/> there may be peace and quietnes, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks being taken away. What maner ſeruice is this with a miſchiefe, which is ſpent in poſſeſſing the empire of the earth, in treading vnder foot the maieſty of kings and emperors? Of the ſame ſort of ſeruice is that, which the ſame pope <hi>Adrian</hi> wrot to the ſame <hi>Friderike: <hi>We woonder not a little at your wiſedome, that you ſeeme not to giue to S.

For in your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which you ſent to vs, you put your owne name before ours: wherein you incur the note of inſolencie, I will not ſay, of arrogancie.</hi>

But now we muſt come to the chiefeſt and principal teſtimonie of the popes pride, and of his treading vnder foot the maieſtie of kings. For after that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſucceſſor to the ſame <hi>Adrian,</hi> had terrified the foreſaid emperor <hi>Friderike</hi> with his vſuall excommunication, in thoſe cruell clouds and darknes of the Church of Chriſt, and <hi>Friderike</hi> being infected with the ſuperſtition of thoſe times, was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be abſolued from the ſame: the pope appointed him a day, in which he ſhould be preſent in Venece in the chiefe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17967:70"/> church. When he was come thither: as great ſtore of cardinals and biſhops ſtood by him, the pope denied to releaſe him of his proſcription, vnleſſe he would firſt fall downe at his féete and humbly craue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of him. Which after he had done, then the pope lifted vp one of his féete, and ſet it vpon the necke of the emperor as he lay proſtrate, and then commanded his prieſts to ſing that verſe out of the pſalms of <hi>Dauid: <hi>Thou ſhalt walke vpon the adder and cockatrice, the lion and dragon ſhalt thou tread vnder foote.</hi>

Is there any of ſo great a number of the Senators &amp; Counſellers of the French king, that can deſire any greater or more ſure teſtimonie of treaſon, or treading ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie vnder foote? Though peraduenture ſome man will ſay: Why was ſo great an emperor and ſo mightie a monarch ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? Surely this was the fatall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe times, which did poſſeſſe the minds of men in ſo great darknes: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which kind, that of <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> is known writing of the Bachanals: <hi>Nothing</hi>

But now we muſt fetch ſome other teſtimonies of the popes <hi>Seruice</hi> out of the maieſtie of our kings that is troden vnder foote, wherby it may more eaſily be vnderſtood, how that the boldnes which is in this pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> being ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthned with ſo great antiquitie, is not to be woondered at: ſéeing that he durſt giue the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med prince of <hi>Condie</hi> this title, as to call them <hi>Sonnes of wrath: miniſters of proud Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, patrons of heretiks and hereſies: that they lie wallowing in mire and filth: that they be heads, captaines, and chiefe defenders of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, that they be most earnest fautors of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: that they make war against their king, against him, and alſo catholiks: that they be murtherers of religious men: that Condie a part had heretiks for his parents, and that he continueth in the footesteps of his father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most wicked perſecuter of the catholike church: that he is an author of ciuill wars and ſeditions, and that he doth execute all kinde of</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:17967:71"/> 
                  <hi>fiercenes and crueltie. And that both of them are a detestable and degenerate iſſue: and guiltie of treaſon against God: and enimies to the true Christian faith.</hi> But an euill plague light on thée (moſt holy Antichriſt) which dareſt belch out theſe things, and vomit out this poiſon of thy bitterneſſe againſt ſuch and ſo great Princes. But as I haue already ſaide, why do we woonder at ſo great inſolencie of the pope againſt theſe two moſt renowmed Princes? ſéeing that he vſed as great boldnes in times paſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Philip the Faire,</hi> the moſt mightie king of France. For in the yéere 1286. it is reported that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight was ſo proud, that he did auouch, that he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his gouernement not onely in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, but alſo in temporall things. Onely ſo? Yea he proclaimed him a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike and heretike, and hauing curſed him with all curſes, he did excommunicate him. But the king being very couragious, thought that he ought not to yéeld to this his ſo great boldnes: yea as it became a valiant prince, he brake and did beat down that fiercenes and madnes. For he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that inquiſition ſhould be made of his wicked facts, &amp; that he ſhould be made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17967:71"/> for the ſame, &amp; ſo ſoon as he found him to be conuict by manifeſt teſtimonies, then he made him be apprehended at Rome, and caſt in priſon: in which priſon (to vſe the words of <hi>Baldus</hi> and <hi>Platina)</hi> he that had reigned like a lion, died like a dog: which hiſtorie is recorded by moſt French chronicle writers, beſides <hi>Platina.</hi> Such was ſometime the magnanimitie of our kings in deſpiſing and repreſſing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of popes. For ſhall any in all France, either noble man, or of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, either with gouernment, office, power, or alſo priuate man, be thought to beare a good mind toward the kings maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in whom this ſo great pride of that tyrant of Rome will not prouoke lothſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and deteſtation? And we woonder that our <hi>Sixtus</hi> being thus taught by ſatan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened by ſuch antiquitie of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, durſt in this his declaration pronounce that, <hi>He doth depriue Henrie king of Nauarr, and Henrie prince of Condie, and all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, of kingdoms, principalities, dukedomes, lordſhips, cities, places, and fees: and alſo of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, honors, and princelie offices:</hi> for theſe be his words. Alſo: <hi>To declare them to be vncapable, and vnable to ſucceed in all duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:17967:72"/> 
                  <hi>principalities, lordſhips, and kingdoms, and ſpecially in the kingdome of France.</hi> What with a miſchiefe what tragicall and Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſticall curſing is this, and furious pride of Antichriſt, and of an impudent frier? Was there euer any that heard more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous barking of a band-dog or Cerberus, than this?</p>
               <p>But, as I haue alreadie ſaid, this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the pope againſt the king of <hi>Nauarr</hi> is not greatly to be woondered at, ſéeing ſuch was his vnbridled furie againſt the moſt mightie king of France. Wherefore let vs heare rather other teſtimonies of like and the ſame pride: for it is not for man to contend with ſatan in railing ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and it ſhall be ſufficient to vſe that curſe of <hi>Michael</hi> the archangell: <hi>The Lord</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17967:72"/> a naked ſword to be borne before him, crieng with a lowd voice: I am the pope, and emperor, and I beare rule in earth and heauen. And a few daies after hée proudly reiected <hi>Albertus</hi> created empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by the electors of Germanie, when he came to craue his confirmation, denieng that the election had without his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought to be counted firme: ſéeing he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had the authoritie of both ſwords. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome good ſpace he confirmed him vpon condition, that with al expedition he ſhuld make war againſt the French king, whoſe kingdome he gaue him for a pray and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his victorie. Which things are witneſſed by <hi>Cuſpianus</hi> in the life of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> in the chronicle of <hi>Vſperge,</hi> and by the writers of the French chronicles. But to what end do we proſecute theſe light and trifling things? We haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the pope of Rome doth claime by the donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of al the weſt parts. Theſe be but bare words. Wherefore let vs looke into the thing it ſelfe. For we denie that there is any king in the weſt, I meane of <hi>France, Spaine, Aragon, Portugal, Hungarie, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, England, Scotland, Denmarke,</hi>

It is much that we ſay, and almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to be ſpoken: but the truth ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere by inſtruments that we wil bring to light, and by teſtimonies that we will vſe.

               <p>THe fourth crime followeth, whereof we ſaid the pope of Rome was long ago not onely accuſed by the moſt part of Chriſtendome, but alſo conuict and condemned. We call the ſame rebellion, that is, factions procured with an enuious mind to ouerthrow the ſtate of al common wealths that are in Chriſtendome. But bicauſe this our diſputation was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally appointed for our country of France; it ſéemeth to be ſufficient for this preſent, if from it alone, and ſo from the freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe factions, we fet teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of that crime. It is now thrée and twentie yéeres, during which our France hath béen pitifully vexed in a maner with continual ciuil wars: do I ſay with wars? Yea with butcheries, and furious and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſlaughters. They that haue diligently numbred thoſe which were ſlaine in thoſe wars, doe finde them to be no leſſe than twelue hundred thouſande French men borne. Is there any in the Parleament of France either preſident or Senator, that dare from his hart ſweare, that the pope of Rome was not the <hi>Alaſtor</hi> * of <note place="margin">or prouoker.</note>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:17967:81"/> ſo great euils, that he was not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall brand of ſo great a fire? That he did not continually ſend cardinals or biſhops, and others of his crue and retinue as meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to the court of France, that they might inflame the minds of the kings (like euill angels) to theſe deadlie and bloodie wars, to theſe butcheries, and to lay waſte the realme of France? When as in the meane ſeaſon he like a bloodie maiſter of fence, hauing ſet theſe ſwaſhbucklers by the eares togither, did behold theſe bloodie plaies from the top of his caſtell of Saint-angell: or like another <hi>Nero</hi> did from his tower looke vpon the citie, which he himſelfe had fired: and did féede his eies with theſe doleful ſpectacles, and did couet to ſatiſfie his cruell mind? But if we will record thoſe things which haue happened in this our realme in the remembrance of our fathers, we ſhall firſt finde this: that <hi>Lodwik</hi> the 12. (alas, what king? Which obtained the name of the father of the countrie with the great conſent of all good men) did make ſubiect to pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond ſome cities of Italie, which he tooke in war. That the pope after a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths did repay this thanks to the king for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17967:82"/> the benefit receiued, that he did not onely pronounce him to be a ſchiſmatike and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, he proſcribed him, he procéeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with the fearfull thunderbolts of excommunications: but alſo he cauſed all the French men to be tormented like enimies, and to be ſlaine: he did alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe reward to the murtherers, forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of all their ſins, and fréedome from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, if any man could murder euen but ſome one French man any maner of way. What is it to be a rebell, or rather to ſurpaſſe rebels in all crueltie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if not this? But it is woorth the labor to ſet downe ſomewhat more plainly all that whole tragedie. That pope was of a cruell nature, and ſo fierce, furious, and turbulent, that his companions in robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and murder the biſhops and cardinals could not abide him, but to the kings and princes he ſéemed altogither intollerable. Therfore with the full conſent of al, there was a Councell called at <hi>Piſa</hi> a citie of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, that by common councel they might preuent thoſe euils that did hang ouer the Church of Chriſt by reaſon of him. And how wiſely, and lawfully, and ſolemnely that Councell was called, appéereth by the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17967:82"/> hundred fiftie one Councell of <hi>Philip De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> a moſt famous lawier in thoſe daies, which he wrote and publiſhed againſt that pope at <hi>Mediolanum.</hi> The furious pope did foorthwith diſturbe that aſſemblie with war and weapon. Wherefore it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by the authoritie of our king firſt to <hi>Mediolanum,</hi> and then to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where after the matter was heard and examined, pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was ſuſpended from his pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: that is, he was for a time put from the adminiſtration of the papacie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when <hi>Iulius</hi> heard, he was ſo incenſed with ſorrow and anger, that he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid all French men fire and water, but alſo he commanded that euery of them that was met, ſhould be murdered: alſo he prouoked cut-throtes and murderers with rewards, as I haue alreadie ſaid. Which madnes or rather furie of his, bicauſe <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Budeus</hi> of Paris, a man no leſſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to his countrie, than learned and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hath couragiouſly and ſharply proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in his bookes <hi>De Aſſe,</hi> it ſéemeth to me moſt fit to ſet downe all that whole complaint of that couragious man and good ſubiect, to be read not onely of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of our Parleament, but alſo of all

Do we not remember that time when Peter and Paul, and their followers, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall builders of the church, were not giuen to fight battels being infected with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of gliſtering weapons, but trusting to bloud and innocencie, and being otherwiſe vnarmed, they were ſtirred vp with the trumpet of most hot loue, to defend the tents of Christ in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult? Now they are made onely bare names, after ſo long time, though the holie principall orders of the prieſts do ſhadow and cloake their pride with the people onely with their maiesty.

                  <hi>power! For who did euer in minde conceiue ſo great wickednes, that the <hi>Top of prieſts,</hi> the master of the cleargie, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worker of holie things, ſhould abide to arme his hallowed hands that are yet hot with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the altar, against the Lords familie! that with a mind more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> murderous he ſhuld ſeeke to put out the top of the christian name, namely a most christian king, in the blockiſh world! and that he ſhould ſomtimes ſhake that mysticall ſword edgeling and foyningly in his angrie purpoſe as we thinke: that he ſhould ſometimes borrow of Mars that bloudy ſpeare or iauelin, and ſhould alſo ſeeke to put thoſe to death whom with cruell curſes he had cast down, which peraduenture did turne vpon him? Lo what hands, what feet, thou dost willinglie kiſſe, from which thou oughtest to plucke backe thy mouth though bloudie and polluted. O wretch that thou then art, Iulius, and carried with distemperature, which thoughtest that thou oughtſt to obey thy blind anger ſo far forth that thou wast carried with furious blindnes of minde? and not to reſpect either thy ſelfe, or the comelines of most bleſſed maiestie through ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but carrieng headlong with thee against their will for the most part, and euen murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against thee, that most honourable order,</hi>

O immortall God! was it lawfull for wickednes perſwading euill things, to throw downe by right or wrong from the top of the ſanctuarie ſo great a man, being euen ſtung with the waſpe of reuenge more than that of Atrius? that he ſhould hasten to destroy euen his bodie and ſoule in the graue of his enimies.

Did he then, I praie you, fet aide out of that tower of Loue, or chappell of Faith, or croſſed ſtanderds?

Surely a ſpectacle woorth the beholding: To ſee a father not onely most holie, but alſo reuerend in reſpect of his age and white haires, ſtirring vp his ſoldiers whom he had called out with the fame of Bellona, as it were to procure tumult in France: not reuerently attired in</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17967:86"/> teſtimonie of the ſame rebellion againſt the kings of France, being not a little more ancient. No man is ignorant that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt halfe the realme of France was in times paſt in the poſſeſſion of the kings of England for the ſpace of more than thrée hundred yéers. When as king <hi>Philip</hi> who was afterward ſirnamed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> did ſéeke to recouer that region in war, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in words be expreſſed how prowdly and furiouſly pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third did ſet himſelfe againſt him. We do not thinke that any man is ſo void of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he is ignorant that in times paſt this was the policie of the Romans to bring vnder them other nations, that if they did perceiue any contention to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen amongſt neighbors, or kings, or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they did carefully nouriſh the ſame, and did offer friendſhip &amp; felowſhip to the one partie by the moſt honorable decrées of the ſenate, and did alſo promiſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aide againſt the other. After that by theſe ſhifts they had ouercome and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one ſide, they found afterward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhort time very eaſie opportunitie to opprèſſe the other. <hi>Our people</hi> (ſaith <hi>M.

                  <hi>their companions.</hi> The popes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſelfe ſame way of their anceſtors, that is (as <hi>Iohn</hi> the munke a noble Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt doth interpret it) the way and foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of rouers and murderers, ſo ſoone as they know any diſcord ariſe among kings and princes that were neighbors, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to increaſe and nouriſh the ſame by their meſſengers the cardinals: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to couenant with the one of them, that if by their meanes they could obtaine the kingdome of their aduerſarie, then they ſhould confeſſe that the ſea of Rome was the author of ſo great a benefit: and that they ſhould be ſworne to them, to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to them, and alſo pay a yéerelie tribute to the ſea of Rome, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome newly gotten. When this couenant and conſpiracie was concluded, foorthwith the prince that held on the other ſide was proclaimed an heretike and ſchiſmatike: and his kingdome was adiudged to him that did firſt get poſſeſſion thereof. By which ſhifts, it cannot be told, how manie fires the popes haue kindled in all parts of Chriſtendom within theſe fower hundred yéeres: how many kings and princes they haue made vaſſals, tributaries, and ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17967:87"/> to them and their filthie ſtinking ſea. Concerning which matter bicauſe we haue ſpoken at large a little before, it ſhall be ſufficient to ſpeake of thoſe two kings of France and England. Therefore when there aroſe contention betwéen them, pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third ſent firſt from his conſiſtorie into France two legates, that they might both terrifie the king with threatening curſes, and that they might raiſe his ſubiects to rebell againſt him, and that they might ſecretly conſult and talke with the biſhops and prieſts of France. That done, he did ſo quickly and ſharply raiſe the emperor <hi>Otho</hi> the fourth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> earle of Flanders, and many other princes of other countries, to beare armes againſt the French king, that vnleſſe he had happily with a valiant and ſtout hart contemned thoſe threatenings and beaſtly buls of that pope, he had loſt not onely that part of his kingdome, but alſo in a ſhort time all the reſt. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whereof is extant, not onely in our French chronicles, but alſo in the Canoniſts *. For that decretall ſhall be a <note place="margin">

               <p>Therfore we ſuppoſe that it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all men by theſe things and other that we haue ſhewed before, what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the orders and Counſellers of the realme of France ought to giue to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of pope <hi>Sixtus:</hi> whom we haue prooued by moſt manifeſt teſtimonies to haue béene not onely accuſed by the moſt part of Chriſtendome of moſt notorious crimes, but alſo to haue béene conuict and condemned. But if happily there be anie that diſpute, that like as bicauſe two parts of thrée parts of Europe, haue put downe the pope, the third part muſt giue him none authority: ſo ſéeing two parts of thrée parts of France would haue his authority reſerued to him, it is méete that his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be preſerued in France: we haue a double anſwer in readineſſe.

                  <hi>being instant. And it is manifest in the church of Seruinus, where there is an aſſemblie of the Christian rite, that in one day were found one hundred and ſeuen and thirtie carcaſes of dead men: and that the outragious multitude was hardly afterward appeaſed. Neither do I deny, conſidering the ostentation of citie affaires, that thoſe that are deſirous heereof, ought to chide with all their might and maine, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that after which they long: ſeeing that after they haue obtained that, they will become ſo ſecure, that they are inriched with the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of matrones, and come abroad in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches brauely apparelled, giuing themſelues to prodigall banqueting, ſo that their banquets ſurpaſſe the banquets of kings, who might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be bleſſed: if deſpiſing the gorgiouſnes of the citie, which they ſet against vices, they would liue like certaine prouinciall biſhops: whom ſlender diet, and moderate drinking, alſo baſenes of apparell and countenances looking downe to the ground, do continually commend to God and his true worſhippers, as pure and chaste.</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Ammianus:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it plainly appéereth how ancient this ambition and deſire to beare rule, which was and is in the biſhops of Rome, was, which was alſo coupled with fiercenes and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17967:92"/> crueltie. But to omit old things, and to come to touch thoſe things which touch vs and our countrie of <hi>France</hi> more néere: is there any of ſo great a number of the kings Senators that is ignorant, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wars the popes of Rome haue raiſed in Europe among chriſtian princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe fiftie yéers, either to defend or elſe to amplifie their power? The firſt was that of <hi>Heluetia,</hi> wherein they ſet at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance moſt peaceable cities, which were linked togither not ſo much by moſt néere league, as by mutuall loue, and deſire to preſerue their common countrie. Then followed the war of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and after it that of England and of Scotland, which alſo euen at this day the ſame fiends and champions go about to renew by their meſſengers the ſquibbiſh Ieſuits, being moſt aſſured firers of Chriſtendom. What ſhal we ſay of our ciuil and deadly wars of France? For firſt of al the popes of Rome did earneſtly deſire <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, that if any would imbrace the reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they might be burnt aliue hauing their toongs cut out, and hauing fire put vnder them. Among the king of France his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, there be extant the edicts of that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17967:92"/> king, publiſhed in the yéere 1534. and alſo in the fortieth, and againe in the 42. by the authoritie whereof the Senators of the Parleament ſhed ſo much blood, and yet with ſo great godlines and conſtancie of the martyrs, that it ſéemeth that the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will ſcarce beléeue it. What theſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fiends gained by this crueltie, it is woorth the knowing by the teſtimonie of him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom no more plentifull witnes can be brought foorth in this kind. That is, king <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond, the father of theſe latter kings, a prince (as moſt men may remember) moſt famous both at home and in war. For his edict written at Caſtrobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the moneth of Iune, 1551. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, the words wherof are theſe: <hi>All men might ſee before this with what ſtudie, and with how great contention our father (whom God abſolue) king Francis, being a most Christian king, and most catholike, endeuoured greatly during all his life time, to roote out hereſies which budded out in his realme againſt our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith and catholike religion: and how manie lawes and constitutions the ſame king with the ſame mind and purpoſe did publiſh: as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and neceſſitie of times did require. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that ſo great ſtudie and indeuour</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:17967:93"/> 
                  <hi>did no great good. For that diſeaſe was ſo ſpred through al the moſt noble families of our realm, that it did infect like a certaine contagion the families of all ſorts and orders.</hi> Thus ſaith he in his edict, which containeth ſix and fortie articles, being all of them written moſt bitterly and ſharply to ſtop the courſe of that religion. Moreouer, ſhortly after, that is in the yéere, 1547. there was another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict publiſhed by the ſame king, wherin by name he profeſſeth in manie words, and doth plainly denounce, that he hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no labour, no indeuor, no diligence in ſuppreſſing that religion. Onely ſo? <hi>Nay ſurely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the more carefully and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we labored to do this, ſo much the more that doctrine gat the vpper hand.</hi> Surely we may coniecture what was his indeuor and trauell, euen by that, that all men know, that there died of that miſerable and bitter kind of puniſhment a great number of all ſorts of men. There ſuccéeded theſe kings, to wit, the grandfather and father, king <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond: his edicts, to wit, ſixe in number, were moſt ſharpe and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides innumerable broad ſeales and letters patents, which he ſent conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually through all parts of his kingdome
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17967:93"/> with ſo great heate of mind and ſtomach, that aboue thrée hundred men were in leſſe than thrée moneths ſpace tormented, ſcort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, burnt and (as it was commonly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the decrées of the ſenate) brought into aſhes, by the decrées eſpecially of the ſenate of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Tholoſa.</hi> This ſo great abundance of blood that was ſhed, might peraduenture ſatiſfie euen the moſt bloodie tyrants: ſuch as the report goeth <hi>Cyclops, Buſiris, Siron, Phalaris, Tython, Gyges,</hi> were in times paſt. But ſo great crueltie cannot ſatiſfie the pope of Rome, whom we may rightly tearme a rebell againſt mankind. It is woorth the hearing what good he did. For there is extant a decrée of the ſame king <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Amboſia,</hi> in the moneth of March, <hi>anno</hi> 1559: in theſe words, which we would haue the kings Counſellers to read very attentiuely, and to conſider of what weight it is. <hi>We to the end we might anſwere and ſatisfie our princely office, were inforced to vſe diuers kinds of puniſhments and paines, as the ſtate of things and times did require. But by the instruments of criminall cauſes it is knowen and reuealed, that a great number of men, women, ages, kinds, and of all orders were</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:17967:94"/> 
                  <hi>preſent at vnlawful and priuy ſermons, ſuppers, baptizings administred by thoſe for whom it was not lawfull to do that. But and if euerie one of theſe ſhould be put to torture, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of our authoritie and lawes doth require, there ſhould woonderfull much blood be ſhed, of men, women, virgins, yong men of floriſhing age, whereof ſome being induced and ſuborned, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome being perſuaded through a certaine ſimplicitie and ignorance, other ſome inticed rather with a certain curioſitie, than of malice, haue fallen into ſuch errors and diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which things if it ſhould come to paſſe, we ſhould be greatly and continually ſorie: neither ſhould that well agree either with our age or nature: both which do inuite vs to vſe clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, gentlenes, and mercie in this kinde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will haue all men know, that when this whole matter was in due time handled by our Counſellers in our preſence, we are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leaue this firſt yeere of our reigne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to our posteritie, as cruel, bloodie, and full of the murders of our ſilly ſubiects: though they had greatly deſerued this: yea after the example of our heauenly father, we are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſpare the blood of our people, and to bring backe our ſubiects to the way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to preſerue their life: hoping that</hi>

                  <hi>through the Lords mercie it will come to paſſe, that we ſhall do more good by the way of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and clemencie, than by the rigor of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore according to the opinion of our foreſaid Counſellers, we ſay, appoint, ordain, that heerafter our ſubiects be not molested for the cauſe of crimes that are paſt, which concern faith &amp; religion, by our iudges of what ſort and condition ſoeuer they be, neither in iudgement, nor without iudgement. Moreouer, we declare that we grant to our ſubiects a general pardon, remiſſion, &amp; abſolution for ſuch crimes as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne faith &amp; religion.</hi> And ſhortly after: <hi>By the authority of the king who was chiefe in this counſel: &amp; according to the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lords cardinals of Bourbon, of Lorraine, of Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the dukes of Montpenſier, of Guiſe, of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernois, and of Aumale.</hi> Thus far goeth <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond: plainly, as it appéereth, declaring and teſtifieng, that the tortures and puniſhments of former times did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all auaile to extinguiſh this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What did then the fiends and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mankinde, the popes of Rome? What did they? So ſoone as they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that ſome of the nobles of that realme, and furthermore that ſome of the princes of the blood roiall had taſted of that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17967:95"/> and had reiected the deceits of <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and <hi>Dominick:</hi> ſo ſoone as they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that France would by little and little winde hir ſelfe out of the bondage of the papacie into Chriſtian libertie: finally, ſo ſoone as they ſaw that ſo fat a praie would be taken out of their iawes, they began to caſt new firebrands of ciuill war through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts of France. That done, when this would not ſerue they appointed furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſſacres and butcheries to the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſcredite of the name of France: laſt of all when they perceiued that euen this way they could do no good, there aroſe a Franciſcan frier our <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, who truſting to his whooriſh and munkiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, did proſcribe our moſt excellent Princes, and commanded the moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie king of France, to purſue them with force, arms, and camps, and that he ſhould afreſh fill his realme with murders, ſpoils, and burnings. But me thinks we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken ſufficiently of the furious rebellion of the helliſh Champions of Rome.</p>

For this is the ſumme thereof: The emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being an enimie to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and infected with the diſeaſe of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, being in a dreame admoniſhed by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtles, that he ſhould

The firſt argument is this: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That ſéeing there be ſo many hiſtoriographers that wrote the facts of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> yet there is no plentifull author that maketh mention of ſo great, ſo bountifull, and of ſo inofficious prodigalitie: amongſt theſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> who wrote fiue bookes of his life.

For after that ambition and deſire to lord it had at that time poſſeſſed ſome biſhops, the Nicene ſynode was gathered in the yéere of Chriſt 325. wherin it was decréed that in euery prouince or dieceſe (for theſe old fathers vſed both words) ſome paſtor excelling (as we may thinke) in age and doctrin, ſhould be choſen, who ſhould haue authoritie when néed was, to call togither his fellowes in office, and to make report to them of the affaires of the common churches. This man was in thoſe times ſomtimes called the Patriarch, ſomtimes Metropolitane, ſomtimes Archbiſhop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently: yet ſo, that neither the leſſer biſhops without this mans conſent, nor this man without their conſent and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie did any great and weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The words of the ſenate were theſe: <hi>Let the ancient custome be of force, which was</hi>

Let vs now heare what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed ſixe and fiftie yéeres after in the firſt Synode of Conſtantinople, touching the ſelfe ſame matter: that is in the yéere of Chriſt 321. For in the ſecond chapter it is thus written: <hi>Let not the biſhops which haue their ſeuerall dioceſe, incroch vpon the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are without their bounds: neither let them confound their churches, but according to the canons, let the biſhop of Alexandria go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne thoſe things only that are in Egypt.

                  <hi>of Antiochia is of all other moſt deer to Chriſt: and like as Peter did first preach Chriſt among al the apoſtles, ſo among cities (as I ſaid before)</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:17967:114"/> 
                  <hi>this hath first of all the name of Christians, as a certaine woonderfull crown.</hi> Alſo <hi>Hom.</hi> 16. <hi>And what is the dignitie of our citie? It fell out that the diſciples of Antiochia were first called Christians: and no citie in the world hath this beſides, no not the citie of Romulus: wherefore Antiochia may lift vp hir eies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the whole world.</hi> And this truly was (as I haue ſaid) the condition of thoſe times, when the pope of Rome was moſt far from that tyraunie, which afterward he had and vſed in the Church. Now let vs conſider what was obſerued afterward. For in the Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was kept fiftie yéeres after, that is, in the yéere of Chriſt 431. in the laſt chapter it is thus written: <hi>It ſeemed good to the holie and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Synod, keeping to euerie prouince the priuileges pure and ſound, which do long ago and from the beginning belong to the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient cuſtome vſed long ago, &amp;c.</hi> Where is that principalitie that was long ago giuen to the pope of Rome ouer the churches of the whole world, by the emperor <hi>Conſtantine?</hi> Let vs heare the next generall Synod gathered twentie yéeres after at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that is, in the yéer of Chriſt, <hi>cccclj.</hi> For when the biſhop
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17967:115"/> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by reaſon of the ſea of the eaſt empire placed in his citie, was ſicke of the like and very ſame diſeaſe of ambition, whereof our biſhop of Rome is now ſicke, he did effect by his policie and ſubtil ſhifts, that that mother citie, which had ſo great dignitie, ſhould haue a certain priuilege aboue the reſt: and that he alone ſhould appoint the Metropolitans of <hi>Aſia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Thracia.</hi> Whereby it came to paſſe, that the authoritie of the church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> ſo greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> and eſtabliſhed firſt in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and then afterward in the Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was quite ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Alſo by theſe deceits it was brought to paſſe, that fower men ſhould be appointed to gouerne the whole world, who had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans vnder their dominion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. For <hi>Africa</hi> was granted to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the weſt to the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> almoſt all that part of <hi>Europa</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> except a few churches, which were left to the biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie and authorities ſake of the citie. Therefore when as in times paſt archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, patriarks, and metropolitans were
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17967:115"/> all one, and were called by ſo many names confuſedly ſomtimes by one, ſomtimes by another, afterward there were onely fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er archbiſhops made (who were alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led patriarks) which did beare rule ouer the metropolitans, as we haue alreadie ſaid. For in the 28. chapter of the ſame Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod it is thus written: <hi>And where the lawes of our most holie fathers that follow, the ſame things do we alſo determine and decree tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the dignitie and excellencie of this most holie Church of Constantinople being newe Rome. For our fathers did woorthily giue the first degree of honor to the ſea of old Rome, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that citie did then reigne. And vpon like conſideration the Cl. biſhops louing God most deerly, haue giuen like degree of honor to new Rome</hi> (note theſe words) <hi>the most holie ſea: decreeing for good cauſes, that that citie, which hath got ſo great honor, that it ſhould be both the ſea of the empire, and that it ſhould haue a ſenate, and ſhould haue like degree of dignitie, as the old ſea of the empire of Rome hath: haue euen in eccleſiasticall affaires like honor and dignitie as it hath, ſeeing it is next to it.</hi> Where did then that principalitie and lordſhip of the pope of Rome hide it ſelfe, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gaue him (as it is ſaid)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17967:116"/> ouer al Churches. Let vs heare the words of the ſecond Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> out of the 36. chapter: <hi>Renewing thoſe things which were ordained by the</hi> 150. <hi>fathers, which were aſſembled in this citie preſerued by God, and in this princely citie, and by the ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirtie that were gathered togither in Chalcedon; we decree that the ſea of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople haue like dignitie with the ſea of old Rome, and that it be magnified as well as the other in eccleſiaſtical buſineſſes</hi> (note theſe words) <hi>ſeeing it is next to that: and next to it let be the biſhop of the great citie of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria: and next to this the biſhop of Ieruſalem.</hi> But afterward the number of the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was increaſed by little and little as pleaſed the emperors. For the emperor <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> gaue that honor to the citie of his countrie, <hi>Nouel.</hi> 11. where hée writeth thus: <hi>Being deſirous to increaſe our countrie manie and diuers waies, wherein we were borne by the appointment of God, we command that the most holie biſhop thereof, be made, not onely a metropolitan, but alſo an archbiſhop, and that certain prouinces be vnder the authority ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: that is, Dacia that lieth in the continent, Dacia that lieth neere the ſea coast, Myſia the ſecond, and Dardania, and Preualitana, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:17967:116"/> Alſo in the concluſion: <hi>We decree that the archbiſhop thereof be ordained by the reuerend councell of metropolitans.</hi> There were alſo other cities called by the ſame name <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> cities, in <hi>Africa Inſtinians Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſis,</hi> which the ſame emperor adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Romane empire, in the yland <hi>Cyprus, Iuſtiniana</hi> the country of his wife <hi>Theodora,</hi> whereto <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> gaue like prerogatiue of right, honor, and dignitie. Therefore by theſe appéereth the manifold impudencie of the popes of Rome: firſt therein bicauſe in thoſe times they reckon onelie fower patriarchies or archbiſhops ſeas: &amp; alſo in that, that they make their ſea to ſurmount thoſe fower ſeas, &amp; do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelues, ſuperiority and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ouer them: ſecondly, bicauſe they take to themſelues the authoritie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of thoſe patriarks, ſéeing it appéereth moſt euidently, that that authoritie and power did belong to the emperors: all which that they may appéere more plainly and euidently, we will content our ſelues with one onely teſtimonie of the ſame <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian:</hi> whoſe words are theſe in the 230 <hi>Nouel.</hi> turned into Latin by <hi>Iulian Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: <hi>Therfore we command the most bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17967:117"/> were firſt fiue, then ſix, then ſeuen, and laſt of all eight: for we reckoned ſo manie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> Wherby we will alſo haue men marke the notorious fraud and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of the pope of Rome in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that 36. chapter of the Synod of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> For in <hi>Gratian, diſt.</hi> 22. <hi>c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouantes,</hi> they haue thus tranſlated the Gréeke words of the Synod: <hi>Renewing the decrees of the holie Councell of Conſtantinople, we craue</hi> (yea we decrée, <gap reason="foreign">

A certaine man was openly betrothed: the ſolemne day of the marriage came, all things were prepared, many were bidden: and behold a man coueting his neighbors wife, brake forth into a ſudden appeale, affirming that ſhe was first deliuered to him, ſhe ought rather to bee his: the bridegroome was daunted, they were all huſht, the priest durst not proceede, all that preparation was daſht, euery one went home to his owne houſe, to eate his owne ſupper. The bride was ſuſpended from the table and bed of the bridegroome, vntill returne was made from Rome. Againe in the ſame citie of Paris, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man hauing betrothed a wife to himſelfe, appointed the marriage day: in the meane while began a cauill: for ſome ſaid, that they</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:17967:119"/> 
                  <hi>ought not to be ioined togither. The matter was brought before the church. But an appeale was made before ſentence was giuen. Yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did accompliſh that he purpoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning or making as if he knew not of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale.</hi> Go to: let vs conſider the ſtate of the later time. For in the yéere <hi>CCCCXXCV.</hi> there was a ſynod at Carthage, and that a generall one, whereunto the biſhop of Rome ſent thrée legats, <hi>Fauſtinus, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Aſellus,</hi> with theſe commandements, that his authoritie &amp; right that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by the Nicene ſynod ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for him, namely that appeal ſhould be made from all Metropolitanes to him. Then at a ſudden the ſcribe called <hi>Daniel,</hi> was commanded to reade thoſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: and alſo that chapter of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene ſynod, which the pope of Rome had adioined for an inſtrument of his matter. The whole fift chapter of the ſynod of Sardis, was read, which the biſhop of Rome had fraudulently &amp; wickedly cogd in in ſtéed of the Nicene ſynod. All the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and archbiſhops that were preſent at that time denied that euer they read that in the Nicene ſynod. Therefore they agréed that the copie of the Nicene ſynod
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17967:120"/> ſhould be read, which they then had in their hands. There was no word of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing. It was decréed that certaine men ſhould be ſent to Conſtantinople, to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and finally to Rome, that they might fetch their copies of the Nicene ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but eſpecially to Conſtantinople: where the authoritie it ſelfe, or the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Nicene ſynod was kept. The yéere following they were brought. They were read. There was no ſuſpition of that priuilege and chiefe authoritie of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome. That could not be found in any place of the Nicene ſynod: yea on the contrarie it was decréed in the ſelfe ſame ſynod, that he ſhould kéepe himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his bounds as other popes and metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes. Wherefore if he were wiſe, he would hencefoorth content himſelfe with his dioceſe and dominion: and would not incroch vpon another mans poſſeſſion. To this ſentence ſubſcribed two hundred and thirtie fathers: and among thoſe, thoſe ſame whom we named before, <hi>Fauſtinus,</hi> biſhop of the church of Potentia, legate of the pope of Rome, <hi>Philip</hi> a prieſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of the ſame biſhop of Rome, <hi>Aſellus</hi> a prieſt and the ſame biſhops legate. And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17967:120"/> moreouer the ſynod alleaged theſe foure cauſes of that decrée of the Nicene fathers. Which it is not vnappertinent to repeat: <hi>The Nicen fathers did moſt prudently &amp; iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouide, that all maner buſineſſes ſhould be ended in their places where they began: &amp; that the grace of the holie Ghoſt would not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in euerie prouince, whereby the priests of Christ may both wiſely diſcerne and constantly hold equitie: eſpecially, bicauſe it is granted to euerie one, if he ſhall be offended at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that are appointed to heare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to appeale to the councels of his prouince, or alſo the generall councell, vnleſſe peraduenture there be any man which doth beleeue, that God doth giue by inſpiration to ſome one man the iustice of hearing and examining matters, and doth denie it to infinit prieſts aſſembled in a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Or how ſhall the iudgement giuen beyond the ſeas be firme, whereunto the neceſſarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of witneſſes cannot be brought, either for infirmitie of ſexe, or of old age, or for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinderances that come betweene?</hi> And as concerning thoſe thrée legats, there are grieuous complaints made of them in thoſe verie ſame letters, and eſpeciallie of <hi>Fauſtinus,</hi> that they had greatly troubled the aſſemblie, when as they feigned that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17967:121"/> they mainteined the priuileges of the church of Rome. Then we ſée that euen at that time the wickednes, trecherie, and impudencie of the pope of Rome was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and that it was conuict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a generall councell. Do we thinke that he did any thing hauing taken away al his enimies or familiars of out A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica and Aſia, that he might eſtabliſh in his weſt parts the power that he did euen then affect? And thus much hitherto tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt cauſe of the nullitie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competencie or inſufficiencie of the iudge: which notwithſtanding that they may be more apparent to the moſt excellent ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the kings parlement, and to other lawyers, we will confirme them with the authoritie of the doctors. And firſt of all with that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaieng of the canoniſts, that The pope is no méete iudge euen in the onely crime of hereſie, but that it ought to be iudged by others. * And <hi>Philip Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

                  <hi>virgin Marie by the ſpirit and power of God his father, that he was made fleſh in hir womb, and that Ieſus Christ came out of hir being borne, that thencefoorth he preached the new law, and the new promiſe of the kingdome of heauen, that he wrought miracles, that being fastened to the croſſe he roſe againe the third day, that being taken vp into the heauens he ſitteth at the right hand of the father, that he ſent the power of the holy Ghost to be his vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, to gouerne the beleeuers, that he ſhall come with glorie to take the ſaints into the fruit of eternal life, and of the heauenly promiſes, and to adiudge the profane to euerlasting fire: both parts being raiſed againe with restoring of the fleſh. This rule instituted by Christ, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs no questions, ſaue onely ſuch as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies cauſe, and ſuch as make heretiks.</hi> Thus writeth <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Whereby we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe are by him defined to be heretiks, which bring in into the Church a doctrine contrarie to the Chriſtian créed: which is conſonant and agréeable to that commandement of the apoſtle: <hi>Hee that bringeth you another Goſpell than that which we haue brought, let him be accurſed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tertullian</hi> in another place of the ſame booke ſaith: <hi>Whence came ſtrangers</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:17967:125"/> 
                  <hi>and heretiks enimies to the apostles, ſaue onely from diuerſitie of doctrine, which euerie one hath either broched or receiued of his owne head against the apostles? Therefore we must make account that the corruption both of the ſcriptures, and expoſitions is there where there is found diuerſitie of doctrine.</hi> Alſo in another place: <hi>Let heretiks bring to light the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their churches, let them turne ouer the order of their biſhops, ſo deſcending from the beginning by ſucceſſions, that first of all the ſame biſhop had ſome one of the apoſtles or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike men, <hi>Who notwithſtanding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the apoſtles,</hi> for his author and predeceſſor. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  </hi> doth in plaine words call thoſe <hi>apoſtolike men,</hi> neither doth he ſuffer any other to be called by this name, ſaue onely thoſe that haue agréed with the doctrine of the apoſtles, and haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein: ſo that it may eaſily be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that apoſtolike men muſt not be eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſea and place, but by ſucceſſion and perpetuitie of doctrine. Therefore he ſaith in another place: <hi>The doctrine of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks being compared with the apoſtolik doctrin, ſhall by the diuerſitie and contrarietie thereof pronounce, that it neither hath any apostle for the author thereof, nor apostolike man: for, as</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:17967:125"/> 
                  <hi>the apostles had not taught things that were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers among themſelues, ſo the apostolike men had not publiſhed things that were contrarie to the apostles: ſaue onely thoſe that fell away from the apostles, and preached otherwiſe.</hi> Lo how manifeſtly <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſheweth, that thoſe ought properly to be called heretiks, which bring in a doctrine contrarie to the Chriſtians créed, though they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues apoſtolike men: foraſmuch, ſaith he, as they be fallen away from the apoſtles: and (as he ſaid a little before) haue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their owne head, that is, their owne wit and inuention, ſomwhat beſides holie ſcripture. Furthermore we muſt marke, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth not properly &amp; chiefly call thoſe apoſtolike men, which ſuccéeded <hi>Peter,</hi> but generally which ſuccéeded any of al his fellow apoſtles: and that not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely: that it ought to be referred to ſome certaine place and citie: but iointly, which ſuccéeded the apoſtles in deliuering the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt by hand. Whereby appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the impudencie of the popes, who did not onely properly reſtraine the name of <hi>apoſtolike</hi> vnto the biſhop of Rome, but alſo they gaue the ſame to fooliſh things: as the apoſtolike ſea, the apoſtolike legate,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17967:126"/> the apoſtolike meſſenger, the apoſtolike chancerie, apoſtolike penance, the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like notarie, the apoſtolike treaſurie, the apoſtolike priuilege, apoſtolike prouiſion, the apoſtolike bul: ſo that at length it may be ſaid the apoſtolike mule, and (ſir reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) the apoſtolike piſſepot, and ſo foorth. But to returne to our purpoſe, that the difference betwéene an heretike and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike man might more plainly be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Tertullian</hi> adioineth a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt example, and very appertinent to that we haue in hand: <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Timothie, doth amongst heretiks nip forbidders of marriage.</hi> Why ſo, <hi>Tertullian?</hi> Surely, bicauſe that inhibition is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the doctrine of the apoſtles: who taught in plaine words, that marriage is not onely comly and honorable for al ſorts and orders of men, but alſo for the moſt part neceſſarie. Whereby it appéereth that the forbidding of matrimonie is not apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike, but hereticall: bicauſe, according to <hi>Tertullians</hi> opinion, thoſe are defined to be heretiks, which bring in doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the writings of the apoſtles. And thoſe are defined to be apoſtolike and ſound and catholike, which contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17967:126"/> with the writings of the apoſtles, do deteſt &amp; accurſe togither with the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, thoſe that detract from, or adde to the ſame. Furthermore to this definition of heretiks agréeth that, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deliuereth *: <hi>He is an heretike,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In lib. de vtil. creden.</note> 
                  <hi>for loue of gaine or principalitie doth either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or follow new opinions.</hi> Where he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth principalitie of faction and departing from the Church, the captaine and prince wherof he profeſſeth himſelfe to be, hauing as it were ſet vp his banner. And with this ſelfe ſame mind <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Philetus</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus</hi> heretiks, bicauſe they had not only erred from the faith, but alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the faith of others: whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in another place he calleth <gap reason="foreign">

But and if being yoong men, and terrified with the blood and infinite murders of the maſſacre of Paris, and mooued with the ſight and preſence of a moſt mightie king, and finally being hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in with the ſwordes of manie armed ſoldiers, they did and pronounced thoſe things vnwillingly, which they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17967:128"/> either to do or pronounce, this muſt not be counted a ſolemne and lawful forme of eccleſiaſticall admonition, and ſuch as Chriſt appointed, and the Apoſtles and apoſtolike men haue kept: eſpecially ſéeing that ſhortly after, when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their libertie, they proteſted, that they did all that they did vnwillingly and compelled with threatnings: and did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie craue pardon for that their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, at the hands of God &amp; Chriſtians, in a reformed church, before a great aſſemblie. And on the contrarie they ſhew, that the pope of Rome is condemned by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt part of Europe, not only amongſt heretiks, but alſo as a chiefe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, &amp; as the chiefe author, and captaine of ſedition. Firſt, bicauſe he hath brought in into the church wicked fables, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, touching the falſe miracles of munks, and traditions moſt contrarie to thoſe fower ancient councels: ſuch as we haue before ſet downe, touching the feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned purgatorie, the inuocation of the dead, the worſhipping of images, the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the ſacrifice of Chriſt in the maſſe, the idolatrous worſhipping of the bread and chalice, touching the forbidding
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17967:129"/> of mariage, touching the Dominicane munkes hid vnder the garment of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie,</hi> touching more and greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done by <hi>Dominic</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> than either by Chriſt or his Apoſtles: which are ſuch wicked, hainous, and vngodlie blaſphemies, that the minds of al the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do abhor the rehearſal therof. Secondly, bicauſe hauing taken to himſelfe lordſhip and princely power ouer the whol church, and vſing miniſters and officers, dukes, and purpled cardinals, to defend him and furniſh him, he profeſſed himſelfe to be the captaine and prince of a new faction and ſynagog. Laſt of all, bicauſe being about fower hundred whole yéers ago, requeſted by the praiers of al Chriſtian princes, and admoniſhed to admit ſome amendement and reformation, he did prowdlie reiect their requeſt and precepts. Of which, not to fet teſtimonies far, ſurely the memorie of our fathers and grandfathers may be a witnes, out of the councell of Conſtance, Baſil, Florence, and Trent: in which laſt, falſe and erronious doctrines were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not taken away, but alſo more and more confirmed: ſo that no man can now doubt, but that theſe thrée markes, whereby we
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17967:129"/> ſaid a little before, an heritike is diſcerned from one whoſe iudgement is ſound, do moſt euidently appéere in the pope of Rome. Which things, ſéeing they are ſo, we thinke that it is now euident enough, of what importance this accuſation of pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> ought to be with the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the French king, whereto the moſt part of Europe hath ſubſcribed it ſelfe, alſo we vnderſtand of what authoritie this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation by him made againſt the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> ought to be with them. For to cut his throat (as they ſaie) with his owne ſword, lo, in his owne decrées 24. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 1. it is euerie where in manie teſtimonies ſet downe, that he that is fallen into hereſie cannot depriue any man of his office, or inſnarle him in any ſentence, as in <hi>c. acaſius. <hi>If therefore, a biſhop</hi>

               <head>The third Nullitie by reaſon of the want of iudiciall order.</head>
               <p>LEt vs now come to the third cauſe of nullitie, which we ſaid to be the want of forme &amp; iudiciall order. For as in times paſt the great orator ſaide, what is more vnſéemely, than that iudgement ſhould be giuen of his life and of all his goods, who was neither commanded to be preſent, nor yet cited, nor accuſed? We ſhewed before, that this forme and order of eccleſiaſticall iudgement was appointed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in iudging heretikes, firſt, that they ſhould be ſometimes conuict of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17967:131"/> their error: then if they would not obey not one, but many and often admonitions of the church, but would (as ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine)</hi> ſtubburnely reſiſt, and perſeuere in their error, then they ſhould be counted as enimies and profane perſons. Therefore admonitions are neceſſarie, and a ſolemne and lawful hearing of the cauſe. God was not ignorant what <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> had committed againſt his commandement or inhibition. Yet he called both of them foorth, and made as it were a queſtion and hearing of the cauſe: and then at length he gaue ſentence againſt them after they were conuict. The ſame God being a moſt ſeuere puniſher of wickednes, was not ignorant with how great and how vile wickednes the Sodomites and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrheans had defiled themſelues. But yet notwithſtanding that he might ſhew an example of equitie to mortall men that are iudges, he tooke vpon him to heare the cauſe, and he ſaid that he would deſcend and know. Which thing likewiſe the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts haue in many words euery where deliuered in 1. <hi>q.</hi> 2. but ſpecially in <hi>c. Deus omnipotens.</hi> But moreouer the ſame ſcripture doth in another place teſtifie, that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17967:131"/> the elders of the people of the Iewes who iudged matters at the foote of the mount Sinay, gaue not ſentence before they had heard both parties, and vntill both parties had laied downe their matter. Moreouer, the Iewes though they did malitiouſly ſéeke to put Chriſt to death, and to deſtroie him, yet they kept the vſual order of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that they accuſed him before <hi>Caiphas</hi> the higheſt prieſt, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent iudge: and then they did bring him before the iudgement ſeat of the ſame high prieſt, after they had caught him, and alſo they did bring foorth witneſſes for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. Therefore both ſides laid downe their cauſe: and the opinions of thoſe that ſat with the higheſt prieſt were aſked: and then at length, iudiciall order being kept, the condemnation was pronounced. But what néed more teſtimonies? When the woman was taken in adulterie (as ſaith the ſcripture) as the déed was a doing, and there was none to accuſe hir, and to bring foorth witneſſes, then ſaid Chriſt, Neither <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> ſaith he, will I condemne thée being not conuict *. Alſo in another place: when as vpon a certain day the Iewes would haue condemned Chriſt before they had heard
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17967:132"/> him, then <hi>Nicodemus</hi> rebuked them in theſe words: <hi>Doth our lawe condemne anie man before he be heard, and his fact knowen?</hi> Finally, there is nothing whereof the olde patrons of the Chriſtians, and amongſt theſe <hi>Tertullian, Arnobius, Auguſtine, Lactantius</hi> do ſo greatly complain, as that the heathen men did euery where &amp; raſhly condemne the Chriſtians being vnheard, and before their cauſe was knowen. But pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> and his aſſeſſors the cardinals haue followed the raſhnes of theſe Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nikes in this moſt mad declaration, when as with certaine barbarous and giantlike arrogancie they condemned the foreſaide moſt excellent king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and moſt noble prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> I do not ſay being vnheard, but not ſo much as commanded to be preſent or cited. But peraduenture ſome man will ſay, theſe Princes were condemned not ſimplie as heretiks, but iointly as notorious and manifeſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks. For they are oftentimes thus called in many places in that furious declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this law is receiued among the canoniſts, that in manifeſt and notorious crimes there néedeth none accuſation and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C. manifesta. &amp; ccc. ſeqq.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 1.</note> iudiciall order *. Wherupon they wil haue
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17967:132"/> this concluſion follow, ſéeing the foreſaid Princes do manifeſtly and openly profeſſe, that they are fallen from the ſea of Rome, there néeded no citation or accuſation, or hearing of the cauſe to condemne them. But we may eaſily anſwer this obiection: for the anſwere is thréefold. The firſt is, that the pope taketh that to himſelfe as granted, which the moſt part of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth ſtoutly denie him, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the foreſaid princes, and of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other kings and nobles which thinke the ſame thing, is heretical: and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an abſurd thing, that thoſe ſhould be called notorious heretiks, which are not euen heretiks. The other anſwer is, that all thoſe points of the decrée of <hi>Gratian.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. which can be obiected to vs, do in no point appertaine vnto the crime of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but (as pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> ſaith *) vnto the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> works of the fleſh: which (as he addeth out of the apoſtle) are manifeſt: as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, robberie, whooredome, inceſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, and ſuch like. Neither ſhal there in all theſe places any word be found tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the crime of hereſie: which crime doth differ from the works of the fleſh, and other wicked déeds therein, bicauſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17967:133"/> hereſie the correction and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the perſon is ſought: which <hi>Paul</hi> doth therefore call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, vſing the ſame word or name, which <hi>Plato</hi> giueth to that chaſtiſement, which is vſed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendements ſake: for in other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the amendement of the perſon is not ſought, but there is an example giuen to others, that men with feare of like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment may be terrified from doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For which cauſe the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Wherfore ſéeing that the foreſaid Princes do neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any doctrine, diſſenting from the rule of faith (as we ſaid before:) but do moſt carefully imbrace the fower forenamed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17967:133"/> councels, neither yet haue bin reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by any apoſtolike church: which (as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> defineth it) hath perſeuered in the doctrine of the apoſtles, neither yet haue ſhewed themſelues ſtubborne in learning, but if they be conuict of any error are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to amend it: we conclude without any delay, that we haue abundantly ſatiſfied the cauſe of <hi>Nullitie</hi> ſet down by vs in the third place. To what end ſhould I vſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words? For euen by the law of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts all this declaration of the pope is prooued to be vniuſt and void: forſomuch as when an excommunication is ſent out for no iuſt cauſe, and without obſeruing the iudiciall order, then the curſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is ſaid to redound vpon the head of him that accurſeth. Touching an vniuſt cauſe, there be teſtimonies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the writings of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> *, where <note place="margin">in c. temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, eodem.</note> he thus writeth: <hi>Raſh iudgement doth for the most part hurt him nothing, vpon whom iudgment is raſhly giuen, but him that iudgeth raſhly must the raſhnes of neceſſitie hurt.</hi> Alſo in the chapter following: <hi>What doth it hurt a man that mans ignorance will blot him out of that table, if ſo be it an euill conſcience do not blot him out of the booke of the liuing?

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17967:135"/> ſentence, and Frierlike bull. For he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus: <hi>The authoritie granted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power of the eternall king to S.

But it is an old rule of the Logicians, that compariſons are vſed in thoſe things onely that are of the ſame ſort. But what agréement is there betwéene the authoritie that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the apoſtles, which appertaineth to religion and conſcience, and the power granted to kings, which conſiſteth in ciuil and politike matters? Therfore our cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Frier hath ſpoken, as if he had ſaid: The fooliſhnes of <hi>Bernardo</hi> his ſcholler doth ſurmount the eares of all the aſſes that are in <hi>Arcadia.</hi> But that we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſomwhat in earneſt, let this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come to light. A ſucceſſor of right, hath no more than his author had. <hi>Peter</hi> had not authoritie ſurpaſſing the powers of kings, but he was commanded to obey them as ſuperiors. Therefore though the pope were <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor (which we proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before to be falſe) yet being inferior to kings, he ought to obey them. The aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is plaine out of theſe words: <hi>Let euery</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:17967:135"/> 
                  <hi>ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers.

For it ſhall euen now be refuted with this one word: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> granted to the pope all the kingdoms of the Weſt, and he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that emperors and kings ſhould hold his ſtirrop when he gat vp vpon horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe; that they ſhould wait vpon him as pages, and finally that proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon the ground they ſhould kiſſe his féete. This is that preeminence of the popes, whereof he ſpeaketh in this place: ſuch as either was in times paſt vpon earth, that of his god <hi>Francis,</hi> when being taken vp into the middle region of the aire, he talked familiarly with Chriſt: for which cauſe to auoid that cold he put on a hooded garment: or elſe is at this day in heauen, where he is ſaid to ſit ſtradling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Cherubins. But now let vs ſée
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17967:136"/> what followeth: <hi>Standing firme vpon the rocke, it doth not turne aſide from the right courſe by any contrarie, or proſperous blasts.</hi> Who euer heard before this, that either authoritie being ſet vpon a rocke did ſaile, or that any ſhip was euer turned aſide from the right courſe by proſperous blaſts? But notwithſtanding howſoeuer this ſhip doth ſaile, we haue ſhewed before, that he that did boaſt that he ſitteth in the ſterne therof, and doth hold the helme, hath not a place left him ſo much as in the pumpe, or ſinke.

But we thinke it good to ſet downe in this place a certaine pleaſant
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17967:139"/> narration of <hi>William Budeus</hi> a man (as I ſaid before) that loued his countrie, and was very learned, touching theſe <hi>Atlaſſes,</hi> out of his fift booke <hi>De Aſſe: <hi>A certain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and merie preacher,</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith he, <hi>was woont not long ago, to cauill at them, and to ſay, that they ſeemed to him to be ſuch as are thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat images in churches, which are ſet vpon posts or pillers. For as we ſee ſome of theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as it were yeelding vnder their burden, which are either in ſtead of corbats, or elſe they reach without the morteſſes of the corbats, and they ſeeme to one that beholdeth them, as if they tooke great paines, and ſwet with bearing the worke: whereas indeed they are without feeling, and they help the ſtrength of the ſtones nothing, howſoeuer they ſeeme to take great paines: ſo we ſee theſe Atlaſſes ſet and placed vpon the very tops of the pillers in the temple of the Lord, hauing indeed that falſe honor, and maiestie of titles like reuerend old men, and their custome is to pretend holines, and to beare a faire ſhew of reuerend old men, that vnderprop the Lords ſanctuarie: but when we behold their blockiſh ignorance or diſſolute careleſnes, it is euident that they do no more good than images of ſtone.</hi> But it ſéemeth that we ought not to omit that, which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi>

                  <hi>went to pope Innocentius, and praied him to confirme his order of predicants. The pope ſhewed himſelfe at the first hard to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but vpon a certaine night in a reuelation ſhewed him by God, he ſaw in his ſleepe that the ioints and couplings of the Laterane church were as it were looſed, and did threaten that it would ſhortly fall. Which when he beheld trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and alſo ſorrowing, the man of God Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic came to preuent it, who ſetting to his ſhoulders, he did vphold all that frame that was like to fall: at the ſtrangenes of which viſion whiles he did woonder, and wiſely vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo the ſignification thereof, he did ioiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept the petition of Dominic: anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> 1210.

But what if the Dominicans alſo who haue now more than thrée hundred yéers with their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnderpropped the papacie that is like to fal, do alſo begin to faint, and to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened? There is another helping piller
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17967:140"/> found. For the Ieſuits are riſen of late, that they being ſound &amp; freſh may aide the wearie Dominicans. So that the matter is now brought to the third rank (as it is in the prouerbe.) Who being now weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the pope is deſcended to the vaine thunderbolt of excommunications, miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the principall matter. It followeth in the bull: <hi>That not onely the times of our ſeruice, but alſo all times to come may bring peace to all parts of Christendome.</hi> We ſpake before of this kind of ſeruice. Which we prooued to conſiſt therein, that kings and emperors do hold the popes ſtirrop when he alighteth from his horſe: that they wait vpon him when he entreth into cities, like pages: that they giue him diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; worſhip as he ſitteth in his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throne: and that lieng proſtrate vpon the ground, and lieng at his féet, for teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng their bondage they kiſſe his ſhooes. But what words are theſe: <hi>At this time we condemne heretiks, that the times to come may bring peace to Christendome?</hi> Would our <hi>Sixtus</hi> vnles he had béen full gorged, well whitled, and ſtarke drunke, not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue writen: <hi>That in time to come we may bring peace to Christendome?</hi> But let
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:17967:141"/> vs procéed to the reſt of the oracles of this bull. For he addeth afterward: <hi>In the realm of France Christian religion hath at all times beene in force, and ſo great hath been the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, faith, and deuotion of thoſe kings, ſo manie haue been their good deſerts toward the church of Rome, that they had from it the ſirname of most Christian.</hi> If alwaies Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath béen ſo greatly imbraced by the French kings, why haue ſo many popes ſo and ſo often moleſted ſo manie kings of France with theſe moſt mad curſes and proſcriptions of theirs? Surely this was the reward and thanks which the popes haue repaied for ſo great merits of the French kings toward them and their ſea. For what power ſoeuer the popes haue, it is euident they had all that by the benefits and great liberalitie of the French kings, and eſpecially of king <hi>Pipinus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Ludouike</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Pius:</hi> as we ſhewed before. It followeth: <hi>We are compelled to exerciſe our weapons that are not carnall, against two <hi>Sonnes of wrath</hi> Henrie ſomtime king of Nauarre, and Henrie ſomtime prince of Condie.</hi> Surely if any man do not remember by the ſword of <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, whereof we ſpake before, that the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17967:141"/> weapons of the popes are not carnall, or fleſhly, but of iron, and (as <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight ſaith) materiall, yet ſhall he knowe this by theſe words of the ſame <hi>Boniface: * <hi>Surely,</hi>

Therefore let our <hi>Sixtus</hi> looke about him, how he can winde out himſelfe out of this repugnance: that the popes weapons are not carnall, and that the pope hath power of the temporall
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17967:142"/> ſword, the material ſword, the iron ſword. That the popes weapons are not of iron, but that the king of France is commanded by the pope, to purſue the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his néereſt kinſman with ſword, armes, and camp: and to execute this his ſentence in ſuch ſort, that all France may be filled with burnings and murders. For this is the very ſame which <hi>Boniface</hi> writeth in the ſame place: that <hi>The ſpirituall ſword is exerciſed by the church, the temporall for the church, the former by the hand of the priest, the latter by the hand of kings and ſoldiers, but at the beck and ſufferance of the priest.</hi> Theſe be the words of pope <hi>Bonifacius</hi> written out in as many letters *: leaſt any man <note place="margin">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17967:142"/> finally an vtter ouerthrow. We are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed by nature ſonnes of wrath: as ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. But the pope is a ſonne of wrath by iudgement, malice, and will. But what is that which he doth often repeate in this bull: <hi>Sometime king?</hi> We ſhall afterward ſée more touching his kingdome.

They ſtriue impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently for biſhoprikes, archdeaconries, abbats places, and other dignities, ſo that the reuenues of the Churches are wasted vpon the vſes of ſuperfluitie, and vanitie. It remaineth that the man of ſin be reuealed, the ſonne of perdition, a diuell not onely of the day, but alſo of noone day, which is not onelie transfigured into an angell of light, but is extolled aboue all that is called God, or that is worſhipped.</hi> By which words our <hi>Sixtus</hi> is ſhewed to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> not yeſterday, or to day, or <hi>ſomtimes,</hi> but <hi>to day,</hi> to morrow, the next day, and ſo long as he ſhall retaine his tyrannie, which he exerciſeth in the Church of God wickedly and vngodlily. It followeth in the bull: <hi>He followed errors and hereſies from his youth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as being by the exhortations of manie conuerted to the church of Rome (as it was thought) he abiured publikely all his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the church at Paris.</hi> What words be theſe, <hi>From his youth?</hi> Séeing that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that religion in a maner from his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and almoſt with his milke, which this our hangman dare call <hi>hereſie.</hi> But that is much more abſurd, He which was falſely thought to be turned from hereſies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thoſe hereſies. For how can he be
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17967:143"/> ſaid to haue changed his former opinion, who is falſely thought to be conuerted? And wheras our cowled Frier bableth of abiuring, we muſt make that a little more plaine.</p>
               <p>The yoong man being ſcarce one and twentie yéers old, being lodged by the king his coſin, was called out of his bed naked long before day, he was brought amongſt fearfull ſwords, and ſuch as were wet with blood, he did and pronounced quiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſhaking, thoſe things which he was commanded to do and pronounce: he told pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> thoſe things by his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats which he was commanded to tel him.

The Canoniſts report that pope <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> being terrified with the feare of the painims, did burn incenſe in the idol ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but yet that it repented him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his fact &amp; heinous offence *.

It followeth in the Bull: <hi>The ſame Gregorie giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the letters of the king of Nauarre, as of a king, abſolued him from the cenſures giuen vpon him, taking from him all inhabilitie.</hi> The pope would haue theſe words to be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: <hi>As of a king,</hi> as if the authority of kings letters, letters patents, and edicts ought to be moſt firme.

The firſt is in that, that he ſaith, that the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> his matrimonie was contracted through his grant and diſpenſation, after that the ſame king had abiured religion. Let vs returne vnto the computation of the time. The cardinall of Bourbon vncle to the ſame king, in the yéere 1572. the ſeauentéenth day of the moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after a maſſe celebrated in the chief church of Paris, with great pompe and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17967:145"/> yet at fower of the clocke after noone, did celebrate that matrimonie in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the king of <hi>France, Charles</hi> the ninth, and of his two brethren, and in a great aſſemblie of princes. Then followed the maſſacre of Paris vpon the feaſt day of <hi>S. Bartholomew,</hi> that is vpon the fower an twentith day of the ſame month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did abiure many daies after. But ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture wil ſay, the diſpenſation of pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> was brought after that abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, at the intreatie of the cardinall of Bourbon. Whether was it then brought, that it might be lawful to contract the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, which was contracted and ended ſo long before: or rather that being not lawfully contracted before, it might nowe be confirmed by the popes authoritie and diſpenſation? If to the end it might be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Libro aduerſus Faustum.</hi> 25.</note> lawfull to contract it, the popes power is greater, than that which the diuines, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, &amp; lawyers do grant to almighty God, that things that be paſt can be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that, that which is done can be made vndon: as witneſſeth <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

But if the pope diſpenſed, that wicked matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and ſuch as was contract contrarie to the lawes of the church, celebrated, and ended, might be counted firme and good through his authoritie: let vs beware, leaſt he condemne the moſt mightie king of France, &amp; his moſt honorable brethren, and the quéene their moother of moſt cruel wickednes: by whoſe direction, and who being authors, and counſellors, that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie was contracted. Furthermore, he condemneth all the princes of the blood roiall, and al the chiefe nobles of the realm of France, which were preſent both at that contract, and alſo at the maſſe celebrated at fower of the clock after noone, and with their preſence did ſet foorth the ſolemnitie of that matrimonie. But the pope doth with theſe words wound none ſo déepelie and ſharplie, as the foreſaide moſt noble prince, the cardinall of Borbon: who, he ſaith, did celebrate that matrimonie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17967:146"/> his nephew by his brother, and the king of France his ſiſter, contrarie to the holie canons: to omit the biſhop who ſoong the maſſe with ſo great ſolemnitie in the chiefe church of Paris: and the deane and the ſubdeane which ſoong togither with him: the canons of the ſame church, and the other muſitians and organ plaiers, which bare them companie: all which, if that matrimonie were wicked and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, the pope ought either to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or elſe to haue abſolued from the cenſures and penalties which they had incurred. Who is he that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that barbarous and fierce arrogancie, that a diſciple of <hi>Francis Bernardo,</hi> dare condemn a king, whom he boſteth to haue béen called by him, <hi>moſt Chriſtian,</hi> of ſo great wickednes: and to ſay that he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the inceſtuous and wicked marriage betwéen his ſiſter and kinſman?

                  </note> the firſt follie of this article be ſhewed thereby, in that the pope durſt ſaie, that wicked matrimonie was contract by the will, ſtudie, and authoritie of the kings, and of the quéene their moother. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is vnderſtood thereby, in that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that he diſpenſed, that that matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie might be contract, bicauſe of the abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration aforegoing, which was ended ſo long before that abiuring.

But I pray you what maner riddle is this, <hi>In the ſight or preſence of the ſeat apostolike?</hi> Whether was there ſome ſéeing and eied ſeat carried thither, or is it that which the popes call <hi>Stercoraria</hi> or the dunghill, in the pontifical booke, others <hi>Teſticulatrix,</hi> or that whereon they grope them, from which they giue ſentence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the abilitie or inabilitie of the new inſtalled pope? And ſurely it pleaſeth vs well to recite that pleſant ieſt concerning the <hi>Stercoraria</hi> or dunghill ſeat, out of the firſt booke of the popes ceremonies, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>The pope that is created is led by the prior and Chanons of the Laterane church vnto a ſeat of marble, which is called Stercoraria or the dunghill, and there they make him ſit down: vnto whom the cardinals come and lift him vp honorably, ſaieng: He raiſeth the needie out of the dust, and lifteth the poore out of the mire: that he may ſit with the princes, and poſſeſſe the</hi>

                  <hi>ſeat of glorie. Then riſeth the pope, and taketh out of the treaſurers lap that ſtandeth by him, ſo much monie as he can hold in his fist, wherin yet notwithstanding there may be no gold at al, and throweth it among the people, ſaieng: Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold haue I none; but that which I haue, giue I thee.</hi> Whether do we thinke that this is follie of the popes, deſeruing to be laughed at, or rather a deteſtable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of profaning the word of God? But let vs hold on in the bull, it may be we ſhal find fooliſher things. It followeth: <hi>But he, as he was of a diuers and inconstant mind, did ſhortly after fall away from the catholike faith, and from due obedience toward the apostolike ſea.</hi> Whether then may we call this follie or madnes? The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was falſely thought to haue returned to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the ſea of Rome: and the ſame being of an inconſtant mind fell from the ſame. Yea truly there appéered great and altogither ſingular conſtancy in that yong man, who being day and night beſet with armed men, did yet notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſéeke meanes to eſcape, that being frée and at libertie, he might deteſt that which he had done being inforced by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and feare. It followeth: <hi>He hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:17967:148"/> 
                  <hi>raiſed vp heretiks, rebels, and ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to beare armes against the moſt Chriſtian king, against him and the rest of the catholikes.</hi> This Latin of the popes, agréeth with the reſt of his ſubtilties. <hi>The king of Nauarre raiſed heretiks againſt the moſt christian king, against him and the rest of the catholikes.</hi> But let vs rather marke the meaning of theſe words. For the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did neuer beare weapon againſt the moſt Chriſtian king: but againſt the popes conſpirators, and the companions of the popes tyranny, his adiutors, and miniſters: and finally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authors of periurie and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: as the king himſelfe hath moſt plainly teſtified in very many edicts tending to pacification. Therefore our chiefe cowled frier, doth wicked iniurie in this place to the moſt mightie kings of France: ſéeing he durſt charge their maieſtie with lieng: by whom it hath béen ſo often declared in edicts tending to pacification, that thoſe that tooke part with the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> &amp; prince of <hi>Condie</hi> made war not againſt them, but that it was taken in hand for preſeruation of their dignitie and ſtate. It followeth: <hi>He hath compelled his ſubiects with threatnings and ſtrokes</hi> * <hi>to take the ſame</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">capeſcere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietatem.</note>

                  <hi>impietie. To take the ſame impietie</hi> is a kind of popiſh eloquence. But that any man was inforced theſe twenty yéers to change his religion, either by thoſe that tooke part with the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> or Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> is as true, as it is certaine and ſure, that neuer any beaſt in the brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes of Rome was more impudent than <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift in powring out lies. Though it be well, and we muſt thanke this pope, that he accuſeth thoſe by whom ſilly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues were inforced by threatenings and ſtripes to change their religion. For as <hi>Lactantius</hi> wrote moſt truly, religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inforced: the thing muſt be done ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words than ſtripes. But bicauſe <hi>Lactantius</hi> doth ſo diſpute in that place, that he ſéemeth purpoſely to handle the cauſe both of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and alſo of the French churches, it is woorth the paines to heare his reaſons. <hi>The aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do feigne that they giue counſell to godlie men, and that they would call them backe to a good mind. Do they then ſeeke to do this by any ſpeech, or by any reaſon they render? No ſurely: but by violence and torments, O ſtrange and blind madnes! it is thought there is an euill mind in them, which go about to keep</hi>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17967:150"/> of France, and pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift came of late out of the beggerie and filth of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet will not that noble man diſdaine to charge him with an impudent lie: and to ſend him (ſir reuerence of the hearers) this paper of defiance, if he will haue anie, taken out of the 51. leafe of his conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>The diuell tempted Ruffine, ſaieng: Thou art damned, and Francis himſelfe is damned, &amp; whoſoeuer followeth him, is deceiued.

Why dost thou vex thy ſelfe? and ſtreightway Ruffinus ſaid to him, Open thy mouth, and I will vntruſſe a poynt in it. Then the diuell being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, departed from him in a rage, and with a tempest.</hi> Sir reuerence (as we ſaid before) of the hearers. But the impudent mouth of that frier ſhould haue béen ſtopped with this ſhort anſwer. For neither did that noble man at any time make any mention of making war, before either any kings or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17967:151"/> princes: but onely of eſtabliſhing loue and brotherlie good wil amongſt the reformed churches. Though, who doth not ſée, how profitable it is for all Chriſtendome, that that wicked and bloodie murtherer of the Church of Chriſt, that author and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of feigned religions, that he who is conuict of treading vnder foote the maieſtie of kings, and the moſt certaine firebrand of our countrie, ſhould be quite rooted out of the land of the liuing? It gréeueth him indéed to be robbed of ſo great tributes, which héertofore he had out of <hi>Denmarke, Sueueland, England, Scotland, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> and <hi>Heluetia.</hi> But the noble man, whom in this place he touched, ſaith, that he was neuer ſo mad as now, when he is like to looſe the realme of France: and that he doth the ſame which the aſſes that are fed with hemlocke are ſaid to do in <hi>Thuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> of whom <hi>Matheolus</hi> writeth, that the fall ſo faſt aſléepe, that they ſéeme as dead: ſo that the countrimen come often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to flea them, and haue almoſt taken off halfe the ſkin before they are awaked.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17967:151"/> about their héeles, they make an euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored braieng: ſo that ſomtimes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen are ſore afraid. The howling of pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſéemeth to be like this at this time, being ſpoiled almoſt of half his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and being out of hope of the reſt, and being now readie to put his necke in the halter to hang himſelfe, vnles moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie kings and princes, for reſtoring his power, do fill poore France with murders and burnings. But let theſe things hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be ſpoken concerning the proteſtation of the king of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> And as for thoſe things that are ſpoken properly and apart by themſelues againſt the dignitie of the prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> we take them to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refuted with this common anſwer. The pope chargeth him that he came of parents, which were both of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks. As it is an excellent thing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but of a man commendable: ſo it is an excellent thing to be diſcommended, if it be of a diſcommended, and diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable knaue: ſuch as it is euident that both this cowled baud is, and I cannot tel what other ſlaues of his the cardinals: who haue ſo hammered and wrought that thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt at Rome, as the Cyclops did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17967:152"/> with armed men, which did command him, that he ſhould with his hand ſubſcribe an epiſtle by them written, and deſiring a diſpenſation, he obeied againſt his will: euen in like ſort as we noted before in the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> coſin to the ſame prince. But it is woorth the paines to conſider, what maner liberalitie this was in the pope, that he ſhould grant leaue to the prince to marrie his coſin-german: which matrimonie is not forbidden, either by the law of God, or by the ciuill law: for in that book before mentioned, the title wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>The Taxes of the apoſtolike pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> the popes abſolution, for him that hath contracted in the fourth degrée, is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely at ſeuentéene groſſes.

Which ſo ſoone as pope <hi>Martin</hi> knew, he ſent foorthwith legates from his traine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to France, to inhibite principally all the citie of Lions from all holie things. This was woont to be the force of thoſe inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the popes in that time of darknes, (if happilie any man knew it not) that they ſhut vp all the church doores, there was no maſſe ſaide, there was no vſe or exerciſe of any religion, there was alſo no

Foorthwith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the authoritie of the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, &amp; the decrée of the ſenate of Paris, it was pronounced, that that curſe ſhould be counted as nothing.

For by this ſhort cut any munke, ſo he be of a craftie and ſubtill nature, hauing taried ſome time in Spain (as this our <hi>Sixtus)</hi> and hauing béene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with the inquiſitors of Spaine, may make ſuch a bargain and league with them, that if through their fauor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation he may obtaine the popedome:

For it is now almoſt an hundred and fiftie yéers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, ſithence the councel of Baſill was kept and held with the great deſire &amp; will of all Chriſtian eſtates. It is well knowen that neuer any councell was called, had, and kept in the church of Rome with greater ſolemnitie, than this. For it was both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the decrée of two popes, namely, of <hi>Martin</hi> the fift, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17967:166"/> and alſo it was held, their legates being preſidents. <hi>Eugenius</hi> being cited and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the ſame councell after that they had ſolemnly heard the cauſe, he was at length conuict of fraud, iuglings, craftie conueiances, and factions againſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of that councell, and ſo put from the popedome, and diſgraded as a ſchiſmatike and reuolt, togither with all the cardinals and biſhops, which tooke his part. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaeus</hi> duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> was put in his place. Let vs heare what maner end this tragedie had.

And <hi>Amedaeus,</hi> hauing (though againſt his will) a cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals hat giuen him, did reſigne his pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

<pb facs="tcp:17967:172"/> might contract matrimonie betweene them, as they did contract it in the face of the church; and that done, after a few moneths he ſent Iohn Lord of Duratium his orator to our ſaid predeceſſor, that in his behalfe he might promiſe concerning his repentance, conuerſion, faith, and conſtancie in preſence of the ſea apoſtolike; &amp; after that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and ſolemne conſiſtorie was made for him in the kings hall according to the cuſtome, in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the cardinals and prelates of the holie church of Rome, and in a great concourſe of others hauing profeſſed all the foreſaid things, the ſame Henrie was admitted as a king lately conuerted to the faith, and as catholike, the whole citie reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and triumphing, and giuing great thanks for the ſheep that was found &amp; recouered. But he as he was of a diuers and inconſtant mind, falling awaie ſhortly after from the catholike faith, and from due obedience toward the apoſtolike ſea, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things profeſſed by him expreſſely and with an oth, and turning backe to that filth wherin he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before, withdrawing himſelf ſecretly from the moſt chriſtian king, &amp; hauing gathered togither in a place, a good way diſtant from the kings court, ſo great a multitude of wicked heretiks, and of wicked men of that ſtampe as he could, he openly reuoked there all thoſe things which he before had done concerning the deteſtation of Caluiniſme, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring of all hereſies, and the profeſſion of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and apoſtolike faith of Rome: teſtifieng that he did profeſſe Caluiniſme, as he profeſſed it, and hath alwaies ſticked to that hereſie with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and hardened mind; and liuing therein vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, he hath raiſed vp ſundrie times here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical rebels, and ſeditious perſons (whoſe head, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb facs="tcp:17967:172"/> and defender he hath alwaies been in France, and alſo a moſt earneſt fauorer of outlandiſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks) to beare armes againſt the foreſaid Charles, and alſo againſt our moſt deerly beloued ſonne in Chriſt Henrie the moſt Chriſtian king, though he ought to haue reuerenced him, as his king and maiſter, to haue loued and followed him as his wiues brother, I ſaie, forgetting all dutie and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he hath raiſed them vp againſt him and all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, he hath gathered moſt deadly armies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten vnto him heretiks of other nations, by whom all places euerie where are defiled with the bloodie murders of godly men, holie temples are polluted and pulled downe, prieſts and religious men are ſlain with torments: furthermore, he hath taken the cities &amp; fortreſſes of the catholiks, partly by policie, and partly by force and armes; and in them hath he forbidden and taken away the rites of the catholike church, he hath appointed hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſters, &amp; preachers, he hath inforced the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens inhabitants to tread in the ſteps of the ſame impietie, euen with threatnings &amp; ſtripes. But thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with himſelf that he had not yet don ynough, amongſt others he ſent a certaine deere friend of his, furniſhed with his wicked ſubtilties, without the borders of France to diuers places, by whom he imparted his wicked counſels with certaine chiefe heretiks, and he prouoked their ſtrength and forces againſt the catholike religion, and the power of the biſhop of Rome; alſo he cauſed certain ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles of heretiks to be kept in diuers prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; at ſome whereof (whiles thoſe moſt vniuſt leagues againſt the catholike faith, and principally againſt the churches, clergie, and all the catholikes of the realme of France were handled) he himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:17967:173"/> was not onely preſent, but alſo a principall actor therein. And as for Henrie Borbon prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hauing two heretiks for his parents, foraſmuch as they during their whole life had obſtinately che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the deadlie opinions of Caluin, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters therof, he following the hereſies of the ſame his father and mother, did commit like offences being but a yongling: afterward with like indeuor as the other Henrie vſed, taking the way of truth through repentance, and humblenes of hart (ſo much as could be geſſed) and deteſting likewiſe, and abiuring publikely all errors and dotings of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, he profeſſed the catholike faith, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Which things being brought to the ſame popes eares, and like interceſſion being made for him, the ſame our predeceſſor abſolued from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and ſuch cenſures, him, and Marie ſomtimes of Clieue his pretenſed wifc, being at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſame crime of hereſie, being in like ſort penitent, deteſting, and profeſſing; and he receiued them into the boſome of the catholike church, and companie of the faithfull: yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he diſpenſed with them, according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his fatherlie loue, that they might contract matrimonie betweene themſelues not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the let of the ſecond degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitie, wherewith they were holden both of them. But he ſhortly after returning vnto his old impietie, and entring that moſt wicked waie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the footſteps of Ludouike of Condie his moſt wicked father, a perſecutor of the catholike church had troden, and walking in the ſame footeſteps, he likewiſe ſhewed himſelfe a captaine and defender of the ſame heretiks and wicked perſons of the ſaid realme of France, and alſo an author of ciuill wars
<pb facs="tcp:17967:173"/> and ſeditions: he conueied into France bands of hereticall ſoldiers being ſtrangers, he aſſaied to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege townes and cities, he ouerthrew churches, he did profane and deſtroie holie things; he did moſt cruelly murder prieſts; &amp; appointing in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces miniſters of wickednes, he commanded their peruerſe doctrine to be publiſhed &amp; retained: and finally he vſed all kind of crueltie and ſauagenes, as well againſt Gods miniſters, as alſo againſt other profeſſors of the catholike faith. All which things foraſmuch as they be manifeſt, publike, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and foraſmuch as we do fully &amp; perfectly know eſpecially by the proceſſe made in the time of the ſame pope Gregorie our predeceſſor, of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, &amp; by manie other documents, &amp; moſt graue teſtimonies, that Henrie ſometimes king, and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Condie aforeſaid are guiltie of the notorious and inexcuſable crime of hereſie, and that they are relapſed into hereſie, and alſo that they are guiltie of fauoring heretiks; We being inforced to drawe the ſword of vengeance againſt them according to the dutie of our office, are verie loth to do it, bicauſe we muſt for theſe offences turne it againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and degenerate iſſue of the noble houſe of Borbon, wherin there hath alwaies appeered ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of ſincere religion, &amp; worſhip of vertue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience toward the apoſtolik ſea. Therfore being placed in this high ſeat, and fulnes of power, which the King of kings and Lord of lords himſelfe hath giuen vs though vnwoorthie, by the authoritie of almightie God, and of Peter &amp; Paul his Apoſtles, and by our owne authoritie, and by the councell of our reuerend brethren the cardinals of the holie church of Rome; we pronounce and declare, that Henrie ſomtimes king, and Henry of Condie afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:17967:174"/> haue been and are heretiks, relapſed into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and impenitent; alſo captaines and fauorers, and manifeſt, publike and notorious defenders of heretiks, and ſo to be guiltie of treaſon againſt the maieſtie of God, and to be ſuch enimies of the true and ſound Chriſtian faith, that they can defend themſelues by no cunning ſhift or excuſe, and that therfore they haue damnably incurred the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cenſures, and puniſhments contained in the holie canons, and conſtitutions apoſtolike, and in the lawes generall and particular, and ſuch as are due to relapſed and impenitent heretiks, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that the ſame haue been and are depriued in law, Henrie ſomtimes king, namely, of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed kingdome of Nauarre, and of the part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which hee hath as yet enioied, and alſo of Bearne: and the other Henrie, of that of Condie, and either of them, and their poſteritie of all and whatſoeuer other principalities, dukedoms, lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, cities, places, and fees; and alſo of ſuch goods as they haue taken to keepe, promiſing to make them better than when they had them; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, of dignities, honors, functions, and offices, and princely pallaces, and iuriſdictions, and rights, which they hold <hi>de facto,</hi> and wherto they haue had right by anie maner of means, or do pretend right; &amp; that they haue therfore made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie therof: and that they haue been &amp; are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent and vncapable to retaine them, and heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obtain any ſuch. And alſo that they are in law depriued, vncapable, &amp; diſabled from ſucceeding in whatſoeuer dukedoms, principalities, lordſhips, and kingdoms, and ſpecially in the kingdom of France, wherein they haue committed ſo manie cruell and wicked crimes, and in lordſhips annexed to the
<pb facs="tcp:17967:174"/> kingdome it ſelfe, in iuriſdictions, and places, and in the reſt of the goods and things aforeſaid, and to get them by anie other meanes whatſoeuer, like as alſo of our abundant power, &amp; ſo much as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full we depriue them and their poſteritie for euer, to wit, Henrie ſometimes king, of the kingdome of Nauarre, and of that part therof, and of Bearne, and the other Henrie of that of Condie, and either of them &amp; their poſterity of al other principalities, dukedoms, lordſhips, fees, and of all other goodes and ſubſtance; and alſo of the right of ſucceeding and getting, and of all and ſingular the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes: and alſo we make them and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnable for euer for them, and to ſucceed in anie principalities, dukedomes, lordſhips, fees and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and by name in the kingdome of France, and in all the foreſaid things annexed therto, ſupplieng all defects of right or fact, if any have happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſame. And alſo that the nobles, feudata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, vaſſals, ſubiects, and people of the realmes, dukedoms, principalities, &amp; other lordſhips afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, euen ſuch as acknowledge none other ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and all the reſt which haue by any maner of meanes ſworne to them, are abſolued from all ſuch oth, and altogither from al perpetual dutie of lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, fidelitie, and allegeance, as we by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of theſe preſents do abſolue and deliuer them all, as well generally as particularly; and we command and forbid that all and euery of them, that they preſume not to obey them, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, lawes, and commandements: thoſe that ſhal do otherwiſe, we inſnarle in the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by the verie ſame. But as for our moſt welbeloued ſonne in Chriſt, Henrie the moſt chriſtian king of France, we exhort, beſeech, and
<pb facs="tcp:17967:175"/> alſo admoniſh him by the bowels of the mercie of Ieſus Chriſt, that being mindfull of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faith and religion of the kings his auncetors, which he hath receiued from them, as an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance far better than the kingdom it ſelfe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe mindfull of that oth which he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie tooke at his coronation, touching the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heretikes, he imploie himſelfe by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, power, vertue and courage altogither prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to execute this our ſo iuſt a ſentence, that in this likewiſe he may ſhew himſelfe thankfull to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, and may performe due obedience to his mother the church. Furthermore we command &amp; charge all our reuerend brethren the primates, archbiſhops, and biſhops, throughout the realme of France, Nauarre, Bearne, and other places afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, in the vertue of holie obedience, that ſo ſoone as the copies of theſe letters ſhall come to their hands, they cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be publiſhed, &amp; to be brought to effect ſo much as in them lieth. And we will that the ſame our preſent letters, be ſet vp and publiſhed vpon the doore of the cathedrall church of the chiefe of the apoſtles, and in the ſide of the fielde of Flora of the citie, as the cuſtome is. And that there be like credite giuen both in place of iudgement &amp; elſewhere, in all places, to the copies thereof being printed and ſigned with the publike notories hand, and ſealed with the ſeale of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall prelate, or with the ſeale of that court, which ſhuld be giuen to theſe preſents if they were exhibited or ſhewed. Therefore let it not be lawfull for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al to infringe this writing of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nountiation, declaration, priuation, inhabilitation, ſuppletion, abſolution, liberation, commandement, inhibition, innodation, exhortation, requeſt, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
<pb facs="tcp:17967:175"/> mandate and will, or to contrarie the ſame with raſh boldnes. And if anie man preſume to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this, let him know that he ſhall incur the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of almightie God, and of his bleſſed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Peter and Paul.</p>
